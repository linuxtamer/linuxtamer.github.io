<p>These routines are part of the RPC library which allows C language programs to make procedure calls on servers across the network. These routines deal with the creation of service handles. Once the handle is created, the server can be invoked by calling</p>
<p>See</p>
<p>for the definition of the</p>
<p>data structure.</p>
<p>A function to change or retrieve various information about a service object. The</p>
<p>argument indicates the type of operation and</p>
<p>is a pointer to the information. The supported values of</p>
<p>their argument types, and what they do are:</p>
<p>If a request is received for a program number served by this server but the version number is outside the range registered with the server, an</p>
<p>error will normally be returned. The</p>
<p>argument should be a pointer to an integer. Upon successful completion of the</p>
<p>request,</p>
<p>contains an integer which describes the server's current behavior: 0 indicates normal server behavior (that is, an</p>
<p>error will be returned); 1 indicates that the out of range request will be silently ignored.</p>
<p>If a request is received for a program number served by this server but the version number is outside the range registered with the server, an</p>
<p>error will normally be returned. It is sometimes desirable to change this behavior. The</p>
<p>argument should be a pointer to an integer which is either 0 (indicating normal server behavior - an</p>
<p>error will be returned), or 1 (indicating that the out of range request should be silently ignored).</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>function creates server handles for all the transports belonging to the class</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>argument defines a class of transports which can be used for a particular application. The transports are tried in left to right order in</p>

<p>A function macro that destroys the RPC service handle</p>
<p>Destruction usually involves deallocation of private data structures, including</p>

<p>This routine creates a connectionless RPC service handle, and returns a pointer to it. This routine returns</p>
<p>if it fails, and an error message is logged. The</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>arguments are arguments used to specify the size of the buffers. If they are 0, suitable defaults are chosen. The file descriptor</p>

<p>Warning: since connectionless-based RPC messages can only hold limited amount of encoded data, this transport cannot be used for procedures that take large arguments or return huge results.</p>
<p>This routine creates a service on top of an open and bound file descriptor, and returns the handle to it. Typically, this descriptor is a connected file descriptor for a connection-oriented transport. The</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>arguments indicate sizes for the send and receive buffers. If they are 0, reasonable defaults are chosen. This routine returns</p>
<p>if it fails, and an error message is logged.</p>
<p>This routine creates an RPC service handle and returns a pointer to it. The transport is really a buffer within the process's address space, so the corresponding RPC client should live in the same address space; (see</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>This routine allows simulation of RPC and acquisition of RPC overheads (such as round trip times), without any kernel and networking interference. This routine returns</p>
<p>if it fails, and an error message is logged.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>should not be called when the raw interface is being used.</p>
<p>This routine creates an RPC server handle, and returns a pointer to it. The</p>
<p>argument is the file descriptor on which the service is listening. If</p>
<p>is</p>

<p>is not</p>

<p>otherwise</p>
<p>is bound to a default address chosen by the transport.</p>
<p>Note: the</p>
<p>structure comes from the TLI/XTI SysV interface, which</p>
<p>does not use. The structure is defined in</p>
<p>for compatibility as:</p>
<p>struct t_bind { struct netbuf addr; /* network address, see rpc(3) */ unsigned int qlen; /* queue length (for listen(2)) */ };</p>
<p>In the case where the default address is chosen, the number of outstanding connect requests is set to 8 for connection-oriented transports. The user may specify the size of the send and receive buffers with the arguments</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>values of 0 choose suitable defaults. This routine returns</p>
<p>if it fails, and an error message is logged. The server is not registered with the</p>
