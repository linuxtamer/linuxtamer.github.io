<p>These routines allow C programs to make procedure calls on other machines across the network. First, the client calls a procedure to send a data packet to the server. Upon receipt of the packet, the server calls a dispatch routine to perform the requested service, and then sends back a reply. Finally, the procedure call returns to the client.</p>

<p>Warning: calling remote procedures with this routine uses</p>

<p>Generic client creation routine. The</p>

<p>has its shortcomings. Since</p>
<p>messages can only hold up to 8 Kbytes of encoded data, this transport cannot be used for procedures that take large arguments or return huge results.</p>
<p>A macro used to change or retrieve various information about a client object. The</p>
<p>argument indicates the type of operation, and</p>
