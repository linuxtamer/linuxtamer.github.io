<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Algorithm::Diff::XS - Algorithm::Diff with XS core loop</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p># Drop-in replacement to Algorithm::Diff, but "compact_diff" # and C&lt;LCSidx&gt; will run much faster for large data sets. use Algorithm::Diff::XS qw( compact_diff LCSidx );</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This module is a simple re-packaging of Joe Schaefer's excellent but not very well-known Algorithm::LCS with a drop-in interface that simply re-uses the installed version of the Algorithm::Diff module.</p>
<p>Note that only the <code>LCSidx</code> function is optimized in XS at the moment, which means only <code>compact_diff</code> will get significantly faster for large data sets, while <code>diff</code> and <code>sdiff</code> will run in identical speed as <code>Algorithm::Diff</code>.</p>
<h1>BENCHMARK</h1>
<p>Rate Algorithm::Diff Algorithm::Diff::XS Algorithm::Diff 14.7/s -- -98% Algorithm::Diff::XS 806/s 5402% --</p>
<p>The benchmarking script is as below:</p>
<p>my @data = ([qw/a b d/ x 50], [qw/b a d c/ x 50]); cmpthese( 500, { Algorithm::Diff =&gt; sub { Algorithm::Diff::compact_diff(@data) }, Algorithm::Diff::XS =&gt; sub { Algorithm::Diff::XS::compact_diff(@data) }, });</p>
