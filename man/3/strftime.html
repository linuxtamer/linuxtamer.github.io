<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>strftime - format date and time</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;time.h&gt;

size_t strftime(char *s, size_t max, const char *format,
 const struct tm *tm);</code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>strftime</strong>() function formats the broken-down time <em>tm</em> according to the format specification <em>format</em> and places the result in the character array <em>s</em> of size <em>max</em>. The broken-down time structure <em>tm</em> is defined in <em>&lt;time.h&gt;</em>. See also <strong>ctime</strong>(3).</p>
<p>The format specification is a null-terminated string and may contain special character sequences called <em>conversion specifications</em>, each of which is introduced by a '%' character and terminated by some other character known as a <em>conversion specifier character</em>. All other character sequences are <em>ordinary character sequences</em>.</p>
<p>The characters of ordinary character sequences (including the null byte) are copied verbatim from <em>format</em> to <em>s</em>. However, the characters of conversion specifications are replaced as shown in the list below. In this list, the field(s) employed from the <em>tm</em> structure are also shown.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>%a</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The abbreviated name of the day of the week according to the current locale. (Calculated from <em>tm_wday</em>.) (The specific names used in the current locale can be obtained by calling <strong>nl_langinfo</strong>(3) with <strong>ABDAY_</strong>{<strong>1</strong>–<strong>7</strong>} as an argument.)</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>%A</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The full name of the day of the week according to the current locale. (Calculated from <em>tm_wday</em>.)

</dl>
<p>Some conversion specifications can be modified by preceding the conversion specifier character by the <strong>E</strong> or <strong>O</strong> <em>modifier</em> to indicate that an alternative format should be used. If the alternative format or specification does not exist for the current locale, the behavior will be as if the unmodified conversion specification were used. (SU) The Single UNIX Specification mentions <strong>%Ec</strong>, <strong>%EC</strong>, <strong>%Ex</strong>, <strong>%EX</strong>, <strong>%Ey</strong>, <strong>%EY</strong>, <strong>%Od</strong>, <strong>%Oe</strong>, <strong>%OH</strong>, <strong>%OI</strong>, <strong>%Om</strong>, <strong>%OM</strong>, <strong>%OS</strong>, <strong>%Ou</strong>, <strong>%OU</strong>, <strong>%OV</strong>, <strong>%Ow</strong>, <strong>%OW</strong>, <strong>%Oy</strong>, where the effect of the <strong>O</strong> modifier is to use alternative numeric symbols (say, roman numerals), and that of the <strong>E</strong> modifier is to use a locale-dependent alternative representation. The rules governing date representation with the <strong>E</strong> modifier can be obtained by supplying <strong>ERA</strong> as an argument to a <strong>nl_langinfo</strong>(3). One example of such alternative forms is the Japanese era calendar scheme in the <strong>ja_JP</strong> glibc locale.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>Provided that the result string, including the terminating null byte, does not exceed <em>max</em> bytes, <strong>strftime</strong>() returns the number of bytes (excluding the terminating null byte) placed in the array <em>s</em>. If the length of the result string (including the terminating null byte) would exceed <em>max</em> bytes, then <strong>strftime</strong>() returns 0, and the contents of the array are undefined.</p>
<p>Note that the return value 0 does not necessarily indicate an error. For example, in many locales <strong>%p</strong> yields an empty string. An empty <em>format</em> string will likewise yield an empty string.</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<p>The environment variables <strong>TZ</strong> and <strong>LC_TIME</strong> are used.</p>
<h1>ATTRIBUTES</h1>

<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>SVr4, C89, C99. There are strict inclusions between the set of conversions given in ANSI C (unmarked), those given in the Single UNIX Specification (marked SU), those given in Olson's timezone package (marked TZ), and those given in glibc (marked GNU), except that <strong>%+</strong> is not supported in glibc2. On the other hand glibc2 has several more extensions. POSIX.1 only refers to ANSI C; POSIX.2 describes under <strong>date</strong>(1) several extensions that could apply to <strong>strftime</strong>() as well. The <strong>%F</strong> conversion is in C99 and POSIX.1-2001.</p>
<p>In SUSv2, the <strong>%S</strong> specifier allowed a range of 00 to 61, to allow for the theoretical possibility of a minute that included a double leap second (there never has been such a minute).</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<h2>ISO 8601 week dates</h2>
<p><strong>%G</strong>, <strong>%g</strong>, and <strong>%V</strong> yield values calculated from the week-based year defined by the ISO 8601 standard. In this system, weeks start on a Monday, and are numbered from 01, for the first week, up to 52 or 53, for the last week. Week 1 is the first week where four or more days fall within the new year (or, synonymously, week 01 is: the first week of the year that contains a Thursday; or, the week that has 4 January in it). When three or fewer days of the first calendar week of the new year fall within that year, then the ISO 8601 week-based system counts those days as part of week 52 or 53 of the preceding year. For example, 1 January 2010 is a Friday, meaning that just three days of that calendar week fall in 2010. Thus, the ISO 8601 week-based system considers these days to be part of week 53 (<strong>%V</strong>) of the year 2009 (<strong>%G</strong>); week 01 of ISO 8601 year 2010 starts on Monday, 4 January 2010. Similarly, the first two days of January 2011 are considered to be part of week 52 of the year 2010.</p>
<h2>Glibc notes</h2>
<p>Glibc provides some extensions for conversion specifications. (These extensions are not specified in POSIX.1-2001, but a few other systems provide similar features.) Between the '%' character and the conversion specifier character, an optional <em>flag</em> and field <em>width</em> may be specified. (These precede the <strong>E</strong> or <strong>O</strong> modifiers, if present.)</p>
<p>The following flag characters are permitted:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>_</strong></dt>
<dd><p>(underscore) Pad a numeric result string with spaces.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-</strong></dt>
<dd><p>(dash) Do not pad a numeric result string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>0</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Pad a numeric result string with zeros even if the conversion specifier character uses space-padding by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>^</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Convert alphabetic characters in result string to uppercase.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>#</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Swap the case of the result string. (This flag works only with certain conversion specifier characters, and of these, it is only really useful with <strong>%Z</strong>.)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>An optional decimal width specifier may follow the (possibly absent) flag. If the natural size of the field is smaller than this width, then the result string is padded (on the left) to the specified width.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>If the output string would exceed <em>max</em> bytes, <em>errno</em> is <em>not</em> set. This makes it impossible to distinguish this error case from cases where the <em>format</em> string legitimately produces a zero-length output string. POSIX.1-2001 does <em>not</em> specify any <em>errno</em> settings for <strong>strftime</strong>().</p>
<p>Some buggy versions of <strong>gcc</strong>(1) complain about the use of <strong>%c</strong>: <em>warning: `%c' yields only last 2 digits of year in some locales</em>. Of course programmers are encouraged to use <strong>%c</strong>, as it gives the preferred date and time representation. One meets all kinds of strange obfuscations to circumvent this <strong>gcc</strong>(1) problem. A relatively clean one is to add an intermediate function</p>
<pre><code>size_t
my_strftime(char *s, size_t max, const char *fmt,
            const struct tm *tm)
{
    return strftime(s, max, fmt, tm);
}</code></pre>
<p>Nowadays, <strong>gcc</strong>(1) provides the <em>-Wno-format-y2k</em> option to prevent the warning, so that the above workaround is no longer required.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p><strong>RFC 2822-compliant date format</strong> (with an English locale for %a and %b)</p>
<pre><code>&quot;%a, %d %b %Y %T %z&quot;</code></pre>
<p><strong>RFC 822-compliant date format</strong> (with an English locale for %a and %b)</p>
<pre><code>&quot;%a, %d %b %y %T %z&quot;</code></pre>
<h2>Example program</h2>
<p>The program below can be used to experiment with <strong>strftime</strong>().</p>
<p>Some examples of the result string produced by the glibc implementation of <strong>strftime</strong>() are as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./a.out &#39;%m&#39;
Result string is &quot;11&quot;
$ ./a.out &#39;%5m&#39;
Result string is &quot;00011&quot;
$ ./a.out &#39;%_5m&#39;
Result string is &quot;   11&quot;</code></pre>
<h2>Program source</h2>
<pre><code>#include &lt;time.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char outstr[200];
    time_t t;
    struct tm *tmp;

    t = time(NULL);
    tmp = localtime(&amp;t);
    if (tmp == NULL) {
        perror(&quot;localtime&quot;);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    if (strftime(outstr, sizeof(outstr), argv[1], tmp) == 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;strftime returned 0&quot;);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    printf(&quot;Result string is \&quot;%s\&quot;\n&quot;, outstr);
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}</code></pre>
