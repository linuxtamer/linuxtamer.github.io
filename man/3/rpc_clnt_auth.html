<p>These routines are part of the RPC library that allows C language programs to make procedure calls on other machines across the network, with desired authentication.</p>
<p>These routines are normally called after creating the</p>
<p>handle. The</p>
<p>field of the</p>
<p>structure should be initialized by the</p>
<p>structure returned by some of the following routines. The client's authentication information is passed to the server when the RPC call is made.</p>
<p>Only the</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>style of authentication is discussed here.</p>
<p>A function macro that destroys the authentication information associated with</p>
<p>Destruction usually involves deallocation of private data structures. The use of</p>

<p>Create and return an RPC authentication handle that passes nonusable authentication information with each remote procedure call. This is the default authentication used by RPC.</p>
<p>Create and return an RPC authentication handle that contains</p>
<p>authentication information. The</p>
<p>argument is the name of the machine on which the information was created;</p>

<p>is the user's current group ID;</p>
<p>and</p>
