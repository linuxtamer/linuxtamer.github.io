<p>These routines are part of the RPC library which allows C language programs to make procedure calls on other machines across the network.</p>
<p>These routines can be called by the server side dispatch function if there is any error in the transaction with the client.</p>

<p>Called by a service dispatch routine that refuses to perform a remote procedure call due to an authentication error.</p>
<p>Called by a service dispatch routine that cannot successfully decode the remote arguments (see</p>

<p>Called by a service dispatch routine that does not implement the procedure number that the caller requests.</p>
<p>Called when the desired program is not registered with the RPC package. Service implementors usually do not need this routine.</p>
<p>Called when the desired version of a program is not registered with the RPC package. The</p>
