<p>RPC library routines allow C language programs to make procedure calls on other machines across the network. First, the client calls a procedure to send a request to the server. Upon receipt of the request, the server calls a dispatch routine to perform the requested service, and then sends back a reply.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>routines handle the client side of the procedure call. The remaining routines deal with error handling in the case of errors.</p>
<p>Some of the routines take a</p>
<p>handle as one of the arguments. A</p>
<p>handle can be created by an RPC creation routine such as</p>
<p>(see</p>
<p>These routines are safe for use in multithreaded applications.</p>
<p>handles can be shared between threads, however in this implementation requests by different threads are serialized (that is, the first request will receive its results before the second request is sent).</p>
<p>See</p>
<p>for the definition of the</p>
<p>data structure.</p>
<p>A function macro that calls the remote procedure</p>
<p>associated with the client handle,</p>
<p>which is obtained with an RPC client creation routine such as</p>

<p>argument is the XDR function used to encode the procedure's arguments, and</p>
<p>is the XDR function used to decode the procedure's results;</p>
<p>is the address of the procedure's argument(s), and</p>
<p>is the address of where to place the result(s). The</p>
<p>argument is the time allowed for results to be returned, which is overridden by a time-out set explicitly through</p>

<p>If the remote call succeeds, the status returned is</p>
<p>otherwise an appropriate status is returned.</p>
<p>A function macro that frees any data allocated by the RPC/XDR system when it decoded the results of an RPC call. The</p>
<p>argument is the address of the results, and</p>
<p>is the XDR routine describing the results. This routine returns 1 if the results were successfully freed, and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>A function macro that copies the error structure out of the client handle to the structure at address</p>

<p>and a colon. A newline is appended. Normally used after a remote procedure call fails for a routine which requires a client handle, for instance</p>
<p>Take the same arguments as</p>
<p>but instead of sending a message to the standard error indicating why an RPC call failed, return a pointer to a string which contains the message. The</p>
<p>function is normally used instead of</p>
<p>when the program does not have a standard error (as a program running as a server quite likely does not), or if the programmer does not want the message to be output with</p>
