<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>pthread_cleanup_push, pthread_cleanup_pop - push and pop thread cancellation clean-up handlers</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

void pthread_cleanup_push(void (*routine)(void *),
 void *arg);
void pthread_cleanup_pop(int execute);

Compile and link with -pthread.</code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These functions manipulate the calling thread's stack of thread-cancellation clean-up handlers. A clean-up handler is a function that is automatically executed when a thread is canceled (or in various other circumstances described below); it might, for example, unlock a mutex so that it becomes available to other threads in the process.</p>
<p>The <strong>pthread_cleanup_push</strong>() function pushes <em>routine</em> onto the top of the stack of clean-up handlers. When <em>routine</em> is later invoked, it will be given <em>arg</em> as its argument.</p>
<p>The <strong>pthread_cleanup_pop</strong>() function removes the routine at the top of the stack of clean-up handlers, and optionally executes it if <em>execute</em> is nonzero.</p>
<p>A cancellation clean-up handler is popped from the stack and executed in the following circumstances:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>When a thread is canceled, all of the stacked clean-up handlers are popped and executed in the reverse of the order in which they were pushed onto the stack.</p></li>
<li><p>When a thread terminates by calling <strong>pthread_exit</strong>(3), all clean-up handlers are executed as described in the preceding point. (Clean-up handlers are <em>not</em> called if the thread terminates by performing a <em>return</em> from the thread start function.)</p></li>
<li><p>When a thread calls <strong>pthread_cleanup_pop</strong>() with a nonzero <em>execute</em> argument, the top-most clean-up handler is popped and executed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>POSIX.1 permits <strong>pthread_cleanup_push</strong>() and <strong>pthread_cleanup_pop</strong>() to be implemented as macros that expand to text containing '<strong>{</strong>' and '<strong>}</strong>', respectively. For this reason, the caller must ensure that calls to these functions are paired within the same function, and at the same lexical nesting level. (In other words, a clean-up handler is established only during the execution of a specified section of code.)</p>
<p>Calling <strong>longjmp</strong>(3) (<strong>siglongjmp</strong>(3)) produces undefined results if any call has been made to <strong>pthread_cleanup_push</strong>() or <strong>pthread_cleanup_pop</strong>() without the matching call of the pair since the jump buffer was filled by <strong>setjmp</strong>(3) (<strong>sigsetjmp</strong>(3)). Likewise, calling <strong>longjmp</strong>(3) (<strong>siglongjmp</strong>(3)) from inside a clean-up handler produces undefined results unless the jump buffer was also filled by <strong>setjmp</strong>(3) (<strong>sigsetjmp</strong>(3)) inside the handler.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>These functions do not return a value.</p>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>
<p>There are no errors.</p>

<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>On Linux, the <strong>pthread_cleanup_push</strong>() and <strong>pthread_cleanup_pop</strong>() functions <em>are</em> implemented as macros that expand to text containing '<strong>{</strong>' and '<strong>}</strong>', respectively. This means that variables declared within the scope of paired calls to these functions will be visible within only that scope.</p>
<p>POSIX.1 says that the effect of using <em>return</em>, <em>break</em>, <em>continue</em>, or <em>goto</em> to prematurely leave a block bracketed <strong>pthread_cleanup_push</strong>() and <strong>pthread_cleanup_pop</strong>() is undefined. Portable applications should avoid doing this.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>The program below provides a simple example of the use of the functions described in this page. The program creates a thread that executes a loop bracketed by <strong>pthread_cleanup_push</strong>() and <strong>pthread_cleanup_pop</strong>(). This loop increments a global variable, <em>cnt</em>, once each second. Depending on what command-line arguments are supplied, the main thread sends the other thread a cancellation request, or sets a global variable that causes the other thread to exit its loop and terminate normally (by doing a <em>return</em>).</p>
<p>In the following shell session, the main thread sends a cancellation request to the other thread:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./a.out
New thread started
cnt = 0
cnt = 1
Canceling thread
Called clean-up handler
Thread was canceled; cnt = 0</code></pre>
<p>From the above, we see that the thread was canceled, and that the cancellation clean-up handler was called and it reset the value of the global variable <em>cnt</em> to 0.</p>
<p>In the next run, the main program sets a global variable that causes other thread to terminate normally:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./a.out x
New thread started
cnt = 0
cnt = 1
Thread terminated normally; cnt = 2</code></pre>
<p>From the above, we see that the clean-up handler was not executed (because <em>cleanup_pop_arg</em> was 0), and therefore the value of <em>cnt</em> was not reset.</p>
<p>In the next run, the main program sets a global variable that causes the other thread to terminate normally, and supplies a nonzero value for <em>cleanup_pop_arg</em>:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./a.out x 1
New thread started
cnt = 0
cnt = 1
Called clean-up handler
Thread terminated normally; cnt = 0</code></pre>
<p>In the above, we see that although the thread was not canceled, the clean-up handler was executed, because the argument given to <strong>pthread_cleanup_pop</strong>() was nonzero.</p>
