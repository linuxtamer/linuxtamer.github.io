<p>These routines are part of the RPC library which allows C language programs to make procedure calls on other machines across the network.</p>
<p>These routines are associated with the server side of the RPC mechanism. Some of them are called by the server side dispatch function, while others (such as</p>
<p>are called when the server is initiated.</p>
<p>See</p>
<p>for the definition of the</p>
<p>data structure.</p>
<p>This function allocates a duplicate request cache for the service endpoint</p>
<p>large enough to hold</p>
<p>entries. Once enabled, there is no way to disable caching. This routine returns 0 if space necessary for a cache of the given size was successfully allocated, and 1 otherwise.</p>
<p>This function, when called by any of the RPC server procedure or otherwise, causes</p>
<p>to return.</p>
<p>As currently implemented,</p>
<p>zeroes the</p>
<p>global variable. If RPC server activity is to be resumed, services must be reregistered with the RPC library either through one of the</p>
<p>functions, or using</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>function has global scope and ends all RPC server activity.</p>
<p>A global variable reflecting the RPC server's read file descriptor bit mask; it is suitable as an argument to the</p>
<p>system call. This is only of interest if service implementors do not call</p>
<p>but rather do their own asynchronous event processing. This variable is read-only (do not pass its address to</p>
<p>yet it may change after calls to</p>
<p>or any creation routines.</p>
<p>A function macro that frees any data allocated by the RPC/XDR system when it decoded the arguments to a service procedure using</p>
<p>This routine returns</p>
<p>if the results were successfully freed, and</p>
<p>otherwise.</p>
<p>A function macro that decodes the arguments of an RPC request associated with the RPC service transport handle</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>argument is the address where the arguments will be placed;</p>
<p>is the XDR routine used to decode the arguments. This routine returns</p>
<p>if decoding succeeds, and</p>
<p>otherwise.</p>
<p>This routine is called to handle a request on the given file descriptor.</p>
<p>This routine is only of interest if a service implementor does not call</p>
<p>but instead implements custom asynchronous event processing. It is called when</p>
<p>has determined that an RPC request has arrived on some RPC file descriptors;</p>
<p>is the return value from</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>is the array of</p>
<p>structures on which the</p>
<p>was done. It is assumed to be an array large enough to contain the maximal number of descriptors allowed.</p>
<p>This routine is only of interest if a service implementor does not call</p>
<p>but instead implements custom asynchronous event processing. It is called when</p>
<p>has determined that an RPC request has arrived on some RPC file descriptors;</p>
<p>is the resultant read file descriptor bit mask. The routine returns when all file descriptors associated with the value of</p>
<p>have been serviced.</p>
<p>The approved way of getting the network address of the caller of a procedure associated with the RPC service transport handle</p>
<p>this macro is specific to</p>
<p>and thus not portable. This macro returns a pointer to a</p>
<p>structure, defined in</p>
<p>identifying the calling client. This only works if the client is calling the server over an</p>
<p>socket.</p>
<p>is an array of</p>
<p>structures derived from</p>
<p>It is suitable as an argument to the</p>
<p>system call. The derivation of</p>
<p>from</p>
<p>is made in the current implementation in</p>
<p>Service implementors who do not call</p>
<p>and who wish to use this array must perform this derivation themselves.</p>
<p>This routine never returns. It waits for RPC requests to arrive, and calls the appropriate service procedure using</p>
<p>when one arrives. This procedure is usually waiting for the</p>
<p>system call to return.</p>
<p>Called by an RPC service's dispatch routine to send the results of a remote procedure call. The</p>
<p>argument is the request's associated transport handle;</p>
<p>is the XDR routine which is used to encode the results; and</p>
<p>is the address of the results. This routine returns</p>
<p>if it succeeds,</p>
<p>otherwise.</p>
<p>These functions are part of libtirpc.</p>
