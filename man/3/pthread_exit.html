<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>pthread_exit - terminate calling thread</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

void pthread_exit(void *retval);

Compile and link with -pthread.</code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>pthread_exit</strong>() function terminates the calling thread and returns a value via <em>retval</em> that (if the thread is joinable) is available to another thread in the same process that calls <strong>pthread_join</strong>(3).</p>
<p>Any clean-up handlers established by <strong>pthread_cleanup_push</strong>(3) that have not yet been popped, are popped (in the reverse of the order in which they were pushed) and executed. If the thread has any thread-specific data, then, after the clean-up handlers have been executed, the corresponding destructor functions are called, in an unspecified order.</p>
<p>When a thread terminates, process-shared resources (e.g., mutexes, condition variables, semaphores, and file descriptors) are not released, and functions registered using <strong>atexit</strong>(3) are not called.</p>
<p>After the last thread in a process terminates, the process terminates as by calling <strong>exit</strong>(3) with an exit status of zero; thus, process-shared resources are released and functions registered using <strong>atexit</strong>(3) are called.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>This function does not return to the caller.</p>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>
<p>This function always succeeds.</p>
<h1>ATTRIBUTES</h1>

<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Performing a return from the start function of any thread other than the main thread results in an implicit call to <strong>pthread_exit</strong>(), using the function's return value as the thread's exit status.</p>
<p>To allow other threads to continue execution, the main thread should terminate by calling <strong>pthread_exit</strong>() rather than <strong>exit</strong>(3).</p>
<p>The value pointed to by <em>retval</em> should not be located on the calling thread's stack, since the contents of that stack are undefined after the thread terminates.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Currently, there are limitations in the kernel implementation logic for <strong>wait</strong>(2)ing on a stopped thread group with a dead thread group leader. This can manifest in problems such as a locked terminal if a stop signal is sent to a foreground process whose thread group leader has already called <strong>pthread_exit</strong>().</p>
