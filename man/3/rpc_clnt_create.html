<p>handles</p>
<p>RPC library routines allow C language programs to make procedure calls on other machines across the network. First a</p>
<p>handle is created and then the client calls a procedure to send a request to the server. On receipt of the request, the server calls a dispatch routine to perform the requested service, and then sends a reply.</p>
<p>A function macro to change or retrieve various information about a client object. The</p>
<p>argument indicates the type of operation, and</p>
<p>is a pointer to the information. For both connectionless and connection-oriented transports, the supported values of</p>
<p>and their argument types and what they do are:</p>
<p>Note: if you set the timeout using</p>
<p>the timeout argument passed by</p>
<p>is ignored in all subsequent calls.</p>
<p>Note: If you set the timeout value to 0,</p>
<p>immediately returns an error</p>
<p>Set the timeout argument to 0 for batching calls.</p>
<p>The following operations are valid for connectionless transports only:</p>
<p>The retry timeout is the time that RPC waits for the server to reply before retransmitting the request. The</p>
<p>function returns</p>
<p>on success and</p>
<p>on failure.</p>
<p>Generic client creation routine for program</p>
<p>and version</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>argument identifies the name of the remote host where the server is located. The</p>
<p>argument indicates the class of transport protocol to use. The transports are tried in left to right order in</p>
<p>environment variable or in top to bottom order in the netconfig database. The</p>
<p>function tries all the transports of the</p>
<p>class available from the</p>
<p>environment variable and the netconfig database, and chooses the first successful one. A default timeout is set and can be modified using</p>
<p>This routine returns</p>
<p>if it fails. The</p>
<p>routine can be used to print the reason for failure.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>returns a valid client handle even if the particular version number supplied to</p>
<p>is not registered with the</p>
<p>service. This mismatch will be discovered by a</p>
<p>later (see</p>
<p>Generic client creation routine which is similar to</p>
<p>but which also has the additional argument</p>
<p>that specifies the maximum amount of time allowed for each transport class tried. In all other respects, the</p>
<p>call behaves exactly like the</p>
<p>call.</p>
<p>Generic client creation routine which is similar to</p>
<p>but which also checks for the version availability. The</p>
<p>argument identifies the name of the remote host where the server is located. The</p>
<p>argument indicates the class transport protocols to be used. If the routine is successful it returns a client handle created for the highest version between</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>that is supported by the server. The</p>
<p>argument is set to this value. That is, after a successful return</p>
<p>&lt;=</p>
<p>&lt;=</p>
<p>If no version between</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>is supported by the server then the routine fails and returns</p>

<p>does this for you and returns a valid handle only if a version within the range supplied is supported by the server.</p>

<p>A function macro that destroys the client's RPC handle. Destruction usually involves deallocation of private data structures, including</p>
<p>itself. Use of</p>
<p>is undefined after calling</p>
<p>If the RPC library opened the associated file descriptor, or</p>
<p>was set using</p>
<p>the file descriptor will be closed. The caller should call</p>

<p>The</p>
<p>argument is an open and bound file descriptor. This routine will resend the call message in intervals of 15 seconds until a response is received or until the call times out. The total time for the call to time out is specified by</p>

<p>in</p>
<p>The retry time out and the total time out periods can be changed using</p>

<p>and a colon, and appended with a newline.</p>

<p>This routine creates an RPC client handle for the remote program</p>
<p>and version</p>
<p>The transport used to pass messages to the service is a buffer within the process's address space, so the corresponding RPC server should live in the same address space; (see</p>
<p>in</p>
