<p>These routines are part of the</p>
<p>library. They implement</p>
<p>Authentication. See</p>
<p>for further details about</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>is the first of two routines which interface to the</p>
<p>secure authentication system, known as</p>
<p>authentication. The second is</p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>Note: the keyserver daemon</p>
<p>must be running for the</p>
<p>authentication system to work.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>function, used on the client side, returns an authentication handle that will enable the use of the secure authentication system. The first argument</p>
<p>is the network name, or</p>
<p>of the owner of the server process. This field usually represents a</p>
<p>derived from the utility routine</p>
<p>but could also represent a user name using</p>
<p>The second field is window on the validity of the client credential, given in seconds. A small window is more secure than a large one, but choosing too small of a window will increase the frequency of resynchronizations because of clock drift. The third argument</p>
<p>is optional. If it is</p>
<p>then the authentication system will assume that the local clock is always in sync with the server's clock, and will not attempt resynchronizations. If an address is supplied, however, then the system will use the address for consulting the remote time service whenever resynchronization is required. This argument is usually the address of the</p>
<p>server itself. The final argument</p>
<p>is also optional. If it is</p>
<p>then the authentication system will generate a random</p>
<p>key to be used for the encryption of credentials. If it is supplied, however, then it will be used instead.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>function is identical to</p>
<p>except that the public key needs to be provided at calling time and will not looked up by this function itself.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>function, the second of the two</p>
<p>authentication routines, is used on the server side for converting a</p>
<p>credential, which is operating system independent, into a</p>
<p>credential. This routine differs from utility routine</p>
<p>in that</p>
<p>pulls its information from a cache, and does not have to do a Yellow Pages lookup every time it is called to get its information.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>function installs the unique, operating-system independent netname of the caller in the fixed-length array</p>
<p>Returns</p>
<p>if it succeeds and</p>
<p>if it fails.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>function converts from a domain-specific hostname to an operating-system independent netname. Returns</p>
<p>if it succeeds and</p>
<p>if it fails. Inverse of</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>function is an interface to the keyserver daemon, which is associated with</p>
<p>secure authentication system</p>
<p>authentication). User programs rarely need to call it, or its associated routines</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>System commands such as</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>library are the main clients of these four routines.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>function takes a server netname and a</p>
<p>key, and decrypts the key by using the public key of the server and the secret key associated with the effective uid of the calling process. It is the inverse of</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>function is a keyserver interface routine. It takes a server netname and a des key, and encrypts it using the public key of the server and the secret key associated with the effective uid of the calling process. It is the inverse of</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>function is a keyserver interface routine. It is used to ask the keyserver for a secure conversation key. Choosing one</p>
<p>is usually not good enough, because the common ways of choosing random numbers, such as using the current time, are very easy to guess.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>function is a keyserver interface routine. It is used to set the key for the effective</p>
<p>of the calling process.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>function converts from an operating-system independent netname to a domain-specific hostname. Returns</p>
<p>if it succeeds and</p>
<p>if it fails. Inverse of</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>function converts from an operating-system independent netname to a domain-specific user ID. Returns</p>
<p>if it succeeds and</p>
<p>if it fails. Inverse of</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>function converts from a domain-specific username to an operating-system independent netname. Returns</p>
<p>if it succeeds and</p>
<p>if it fails. Inverse of</p>
<p>These functions are part of libtirpc.</p>
