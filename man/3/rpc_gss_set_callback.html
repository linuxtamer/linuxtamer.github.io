<p>Register a function which will be called when new security contexts are created on a server. This function will be called on the first RPC request which uses that context and has the opportunity of rejecting the request (for instance after matching the request credentials to an access control list). To accept the new security context, the callback should return</p>
<p>otherwise</p>
<p>If the callback accepts a context, it becomes responsible for the lifetime of the delegated client credentials (if any).</p>
<p>It is also possible to 'lock' the values of service and quality of protection used by the context. If a context is locked, any subsequent requests which use different values for service and quality of protection will be rejected.</p>

<p>There is no mechanism for informing a server when a security context has been deleted. This makes it difficult to allocate resources (e.g. to return via the callback's</p>
