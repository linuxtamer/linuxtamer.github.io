<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Dpkg::Vendor::Default - default vendor class</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>A vendor class is used to provide vendor specific behaviour in various places. This is the default class used in case there's none for the current vendor or in case the vendor could not be identified (see Dpkg::Vendor documentation).</p>
<p>It provides some hooks that are called by various dpkg-* tools. If you need a new hook, please file a bug against dpkg-dev and explain your need. Note that the hook API has no guarantee to be stable over an extended period of time. If you run an important distribution that makes use of vendor hooks, you'd better submit them for integration so that we avoid breaking your code.</p>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Creates the default vendor object. Can be inherited by all vendor objects if they don't need any specific initialization at object creation time.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the corresponding hook. The parameters are hook-specific. The supported hooks are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first parameter is a Dpkg::Source::Package object. The hook is called just before the execution of <code>$srcpkg</code>-&gt;<strong>build()</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The hook is called when dpkg-source is checking a signature on a source package (since dpkg 1.18.11). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly empty) list of vendor-specific keyrings.</p></li>
<li><p>The hook is called when there is a need to check signatures on artifacts from repositories, for example by a download method (since dpkg 1.18.11). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly empty) list of vendor-specific keyrings.</p></li>
<li><p>The hook is called when there is a need to check signatures on artifacts from historic repositories, for example by a download method (since dpkg 1.18.11). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly empty) list of vendor-specific keyrings.</p></li>
<li><p>The hook is called when dpkg-checkbuilddeps is initializing the source package build dependencies (since dpkg 1.18.2). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly empty) list of vendor-specific <strong>Build-Depends</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The hook is called when dpkg-checkbuilddeps is initializing the source package build conflicts (since dpkg 1.18.2). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly empty) list of vendor-specific <strong>Build-Conflicts</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The hook is called in Dpkg::Control::Fields to register custom fields. You should return a list of arrays. Each array is an operation to perform. The first item is the name of the operation and corresponds to a field_* function provided by Dpkg::Control::Fields. The remaining fields are the parameters that are passed unchanged to the corresponding function. Known operations are register, insert_after and insert_before.</p></li>
<li><p>The hook is called in Dpkg::Changelog to post-process a Dpkg::Changelog::Entry after it has been created and filled with the appropriate values.</p></li>
<li><p>The hook is called in Dpkg::BuildFlags to allow the vendor to override the default values set for the various build flags. <code>$flags</code> is a Dpkg::BuildFlags object.</p></li>
<li><p>The hook is called by dpkg-genbuildinfo to determine if the current path should be recorded in the <strong>Build-Path</strong> field (since dpkg 1.18.11). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly empty) list of root paths considered acceptable. As an example, if the list contains /build/, a Build-Path field will be created if the current directory is /build/dpkg-1.18.0. If the list contains /, the path will always be recorded. If the list is empty, the current path will never be recorded.</p></li>
<li><p>The hook is called by dpkg-genbuildinfo to determine if the current system has been tainted in some way that could affect the resulting build, which will be recorded in the <strong>Build-Tainted-By</strong> field (since dpkg 1.19.5). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly empty) list of tainted reason tags (formed by alphanumeric and dash characters).</p></li>
<li><p>The hook is called by dpkg-buildpackage to sanitize its build environment (since dpkg 1.20.0).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
