<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Algorithm::DiffOld - Compute `intelligent' differences between two files / lists but use the old (&lt;=0.59) interface.</p>
<h1>NOTE</h1>
<p>This has been provided as part of the Algorithm::Diff package by Ned Konz. This particular module is <strong>ONLY</strong> for people who <strong>HAVE</strong> to have the old interface, which uses a comparison function rather than a key generating function.</p>
<p>Because each of the lines in one array have to be compared with each of the lines in the other array, this does M*N comparisons. This can be very slow. I clocked it at taking 18 times as long as the stock version of Algorithm::Diff for a 4000-line file. It will get worse quadratically as array sizes increase.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>use Algorithm::DiffOld qw(diff LCS traverse_sequences); @lcs = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2, $comparison_function ); $lcsref = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2, $comparison_function ); @diffs = diff( \@seq1, \@seq2, $comparison_function ); traverse_sequences( \@seq1, \@seq2, { MATCH =&gt; $callback, DISCARD_A =&gt; $callback, DISCARD_B =&gt; $callback, }, $comparison_function );</p>
<h1>COMPARISON FUNCTIONS</h1>
<p>Each of the main routines should be passed a comparison function. If you aren't passing one in, <strong>use Algorithm::Diff instead</strong>.</p>
<p>These functions should return a true value when two items should compare as equal.</p>
<p>For instance,</p>
<p>@lcs = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2, sub { my ($a, $b) = @_; $a eq $b } );</p>
<p>but if that is all you're doing with your comparison function, just use Algorithm::Diff and let it do this (this is its default).</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>sub someFunkyComparisonFunction { my ($a, $b) = @_; $a =~ m{$b}; } @diffs = diff( \@lines, \@patterns, \&amp;someFunkyComparisonFunction );</p>
<p>which would allow you to diff an array <code>@lines</code> which consists of text lines with an array <code>@patterns</code> which consists of regular expressions.</p>
<p>This is actually the reason I wrote this version Î©- there is no way to do this with a key generation function as in the stock Algorithm::Diff.</p>
