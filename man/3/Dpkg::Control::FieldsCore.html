<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>Dpkg::Control::FieldsCore - manage (list of official) control fields</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The modules contains a list of fieldnames with associated meta-data explaining in which type of control information they are allowed. The types are the CTRL_* constants exported by Dpkg::Control.</p>
<h1>FUNCTIONS</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Returns the field name properly capitalized. All characters are lowercase, except the first of each word (words are separated by a hyphen in field names).</p></li>
<li><p>Returns true if the field is official and known.</p></li>
<li><p>Returns true (1) if the field <code>$fname</code> is allowed in all the types listed in the list. Note that you can use type sets instead of individual types (ex: CTRL_FILE_CHANGES | CTRL_CHANGELOG). field_allowed_in(A|B, C) returns true only if the field is allowed in C and either A or B. Undef is returned for non-official fields.</p></li>
<li><p>If appropriate, copy the value of the field named <code>$field</code> taken from the <code>$from</code> Dpkg::Control object to the <code>$to</code> Dpkg::Control object. Official fields are copied only if the field is allowed in both types of objects. Custom fields are treated in a specific manner. When the target is not among CTRL_PKG_SRC, CTRL_PKG_DEB or CTRL_FILE_CHANGES, then they are always copied as is (the X- prefix is kept). Otherwise they are not copied except if the target object matches the target destination encoded in the field name. The initial X denoting custom fields can be followed by one or more letters among S (Source: corresponds to CTRL_PKG_SRC), B (Binary: corresponds to CTRL_PKG_DEB) or C (Changes: corresponds to CTRL_FILE_CHANGES). Returns undef if nothing has been copied or the name of the new field added to <code>$to</code> otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Transfer all appropriate fields from <code>$from</code> to <code>$to</code>. Calls <strong>field_transfer_single()</strong> on all fields available in <code>$from</code>. Returns the list of fields that have been added to <code>$to</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Returns an ordered list of fields for a given type of control information. This list can be used to output the fields in a predictable order. The list might be empty for types where the order does not matter much.</p></li>
<li><p>List of fields that contains dependencies-like information in a source Debian package.</p></li>
<li><p>List of fields that contains dependencies-like information in a binary Debian package. The fields that express real dependencies are sorted from the stronger to the weaker.</p></li>
<li><p>Return the type of the dependency expressed by the given field. Can either be normal for a real dependency field (Pre-Depends, Depends, ...) or union for other relation fields sharing the same syntax (Conflicts, Breaks, ...). Returns undef for fields which are not dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Return the type of the field value separator. Can be one of FIELD_SEP_UNKNOWN, FIELD_SEP_SPACE, FIELD_SEP_COMMA or FIELD_SEP_LINE.</p></li>
<li><p>Register a new field as being allowed in control information of specified types. <code>%opts</code> is optional</p></li>
<li><p>Place field after another one ($ref) in output of control information of type <code>$type</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Place field before another one ($ref) in output of control information of type <code>$type</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
