<p>The</p>

<p>is a structure of type</p>
<p>It has at least these fields:</p>

<p>and</p>
<p>fields to store the strings that they will pass as</p>

<p>This will make it easier to erase all sensitive data after it is no longer needed.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>field must be set to zero before the first time a</p>
<p>object is first used in a call to</p>
<p>We recommend zeroing the entire object, not just</p>
<p>and not just the documented fields, before the first use. (Of course, do this before storing anything in</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>argument to</p>

<p>When used with</p>
<p>the entire</p>
<p>object (except for the</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>fields) must be zeroed before its first use; this is not just a recommendation, as it is for</p>

<p>return a null pointer.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>may also return a null pointer, or they may return a pointer to the invalid hash, depending on how libcrypt was configured. (The option to return the invalid hash is for compatibility with old applications that assume that</p>
<p>cannot return a null pointer. See</p>

<p>and</p>
<p>are not part of any standard.</p>
<p>POSIX does not specify any hashing methods, and does not require hashed passphrases to be portable between systems. In practice, hashed passphrases are portable as long as both systems support the hashing method that was used. However, the set of supported hashing methods varies considerably from system to system.</p>
<p>The behavior of</p>
<p>on errors isn't well standardized. Some implementations simply can't fail (except by crashing the program), others return a null pointer or a fixed string. Most implementations don't set</p>
<p>but some do. POSIX specifies returning a null pointer and setting</p>
<p>but it defines only one possible error,</p>
<p>in the case where</p>
<p>is not supported at all. Some older applications are not prepared to handle null pointers returned by</p>
<p>The behavior described above for this implementation, setting</p>
<p>and returning an invalid hashed passphrase different from</p>

<p>Due to historical restrictions on the export of cryptographic software from the USA,</p>
<p>is an optional POSIX component. Applications should therefore be prepared for</p>
<p>not to be available, or to always fail (setting</p>

<p>POSIX specifies that</p>
<p>is declared in</p>
<p>but only if the macro</p>
<p>is defined and has a value greater than or equal to zero. Since libcrypt does not provide</p>
<p>it declares</p>

<p>instead.</p>
<p>On a minority of systems (notably recent versions of Solaris),</p>
<p>uses a thread-specific static storage buffer, which makes it safe to call from multiple threads simultaneously, but does not prevent each call within a thread from overwriting the results of the previous one.</p>
<p>Some implementations of</p>
<p>upon error, return an invalid hash that is stored in a read-only location or only initialized once, which means that it is only safe to erase the buffer pointed to by the</p>
<p>return value if an error did not occur.</p>
<p>may be quite large (32kB in this implementation of libcrypt; over 128kB in some other implementations). This is large enough that it may be unwise to allocate it on the stack.</p>
<p>Some recently designed hashing methods need even more scratch memory, but the</p>
<p>interface makes it impossible to change the size of</p>
<p>without breaking binary compatibility. The</p>
<p>interface could accommodate larger allocations for specific hashing methods, but the caller of</p>
