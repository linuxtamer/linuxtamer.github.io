<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>ddp - Linux AppleTalk protocol implementation</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</strong><br />
<strong>#include &lt;netatalk/at.h&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>ddp_socket</em><strong> = socket(AF_APPLETALK, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);</strong><br />
<em>raw_socket</em><strong> = socket(AF_APPLETALK, SOCK_RAW, </strong><em>protocol</em><strong>);</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Linux implements the AppleTalk protocols described in <em>Inside AppleTalk</em>. Only the DDP layer and AARP are present in the kernel. They are designed to be used via the <strong>netatalk</strong> protocol libraries. This page documents the interface for those who wish or need to use the DDP layer directly.</p>
<p>The communication between AppleTalk and the user program works using a BSD-compatible socket interface. For more information on sockets, see <strong>socket</strong>(7).</p>
<p>An AppleTalk socket is created by calling the <strong>socket</strong>(2) function with a <strong>AF_APPLETALK</strong> socket family argument. Valid socket types are <strong>SOCK_DGRAM</strong> to open a <strong>ddp</strong> socket or <strong>SOCK_RAW</strong> to open a <strong>raw</strong> socket. <em>protocol</em> is the AppleTalk protocol to be received or sent. For <strong>SOCK_RAW</strong> you must specify <strong>ATPROTO_DDP</strong>.</p>
<p>Raw sockets may be opened only by a process with effective user ID 0 or when the process has the <strong>CAP_NET_RAW</strong> capability.</p>
<h2>Address format</h2>
<p>An AppleTalk socket address is defined as a combination of a network number, a node number, and a port number.</p>
<pre><code>struct at_addr {
    unsigned short s_net;
    unsigned char  s_node;
};

struct sockaddr_atalk {
    sa_family_t    sat_family;    /* address family */
    unsigned char  sat_port;      /* port */
    struct at_addr sat_addr;      /* net/node */
};</code></pre>
<p><em>sat_family</em> is always set to <strong>AF_APPLETALK</strong>. <em>sat_port</em> contains the port. The port numbers below 129 are known as <em>reserved ports</em>. Only processes with the effective user ID 0 or the <strong>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</strong> capability may <strong>bind</strong>(2) to these sockets. <em>sat_addr</em> is the host address. The <em>net</em> member of <em>struct at_addr</em> contains the host network in network byte order. The value of <strong>AT_ANYNET</strong> is a wildcard and also implies “this network.” The <em>node</em> member of <em>struct at_addr</em> contains the host node number. The value of <strong>AT_ANYNODE</strong> is a wildcard and also implies “this node.” The value of <strong>ATADDR_BCAST</strong> is a link local broadcast address.</p>
<h2>Socket options</h2>
<p>No protocol-specific socket options are supported.</p>
<h2>/proc interfaces</h2>
<p>IP supports a set of <em>/proc</em> interfaces to configure some global AppleTalk parameters. The parameters can be accessed by reading or writing files in the directory <em>/proc/sys/net/atalk/</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>aarp-expiry-time</em></dt>
<dd><p>The time interval (in seconds) before an AARP cache entry expires.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>aarp-resolve-time</em></dt>
<dd><p>The time interval (in seconds) before an AARP cache entry is resolved.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>aarp-retransmit-limit</em></dt>
<dd><p>The number of retransmissions of an AARP query before the node is declared dead.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>aarp-tick-time</em></dt>
<dd><p>The timer rate (in seconds) for the timer driving AARP.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The default values match the specification and should never need to be changed.</p>
<h2>Ioctls</h2>
<p>All ioctls described in <strong>socket</strong>(7) apply to DDP.</p>

<h1>VERSIONS</h1>
<p>AppleTalk is supported by Linux 2.0 or higher. The <em>/proc</em> interfaces exist since Linux 2.2.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Be very careful with the <strong>SO_BROADCAST</strong> option; it is not privileged in Linux. It is easy to overload the network with careless sending to broadcast addresses.</p>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>The basic AppleTalk socket interface is compatible with <strong>netatalk</strong> on BSD-derived systems. Many BSD systems fail to check <strong>SO_BROADCAST</strong> when sending broadcast frames; this can lead to compatibility problems.</p>
<p>The raw socket mode is unique to Linux and exists to support the alternative CAP package and AppleTalk monitoring tools more easily.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>There are too many inconsistent error values.</p>
<p>The ioctls used to configure routing tables, devices, AARP tables, and other devices are not yet described.</p>
