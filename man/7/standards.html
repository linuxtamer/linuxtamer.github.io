<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>standards - C and UNIX Standards</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The CONFORMING TO section that appears in many manual pages identifies various standards to which the documented interface conforms. The following list briefly describes these standards.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>V7</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Version 7 (also known as Seventh Edition) UNIX, released by AT&amp;T/Bell Labs in 1979. After this point, UNIX systems diverged into two main dialects: BSD and System V.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>4.2BSD</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is an implementation standard defined by the 4.2 release of the <em>Berkeley Software Distribution</em>, released by the University of California at Berkeley. This was the first Berkeley release that contained a TCP/IP stack and the sockets API. 4.2BSD was released in 1983.</p>
<p>Earlier major BSD releases included <em>3BSD</em> (1980), <em>4BSD</em> (1980), and <em>4.1BSD</em> (1981).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>4.3BSD</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The successor to 4.2BSD, released in 1986.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>4.4BSD</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The successor to 4.3BSD, released in 1993. This was the last major Berkeley release.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>System V</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is an implementation standard defined by AT&amp;T's milestone 1983 release of its commercial System V (five) release. The previous major AT&amp;T release was <em>System III</em>, released in 1981.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>System V release 2 (SVr2)</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This was the next System V release, made in 1985. The SVr2 was formally described in the <em>System V Interface Definition version 1</em> (<em>SVID 1</em>) published in 1985.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>System V release 3 (SVr3)</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This was the successor to SVr2, released in 1986. This release was formally described in the <em>System V Interface Definition version 2</em> (<em>SVID 2</em>).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>System V release 4 (SVr4)</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This was the successor to SVr3, released in 1989. This version of System V is described in the "Programmer's Reference Manual: Operating System API (Intel processors)" (Prentice-Hall 1992, ISBN 0-13-951294-2) This release was formally described in the <em>System V Interface Definition version 3</em> (<em>SVID 3</em>), and is considered the definitive System V release.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SVID 4</strong></dt>
<dd><p>System V Interface Definition version 4, issued in 1995. Available online at <a href="http://www.sco.com/developers/devspecs/"></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>C89</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This was the first C language standard, ratified by ANSI (American National Standards Institute) in 1989 (<em>X3.159-1989</em>). Sometimes this is known as <em>ANSI C</em>, but since C99 is also an ANSI standard, this term is ambiguous. This standard was also ratified by ISO (International Standards Organization) in 1990 (<em>ISO/IEC 9899:1990</em>), and is thus occasionally referred to as <em>ISO C90</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>C99</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This revision of the C language standard was ratified by ISO in 1999 (<em>ISO/IEC 9899:1999</em>). Available online at <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards"></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>C11</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This revision of the C language standard was ratified by ISO in 2011 (<em>ISO/IEC 9899:2011</em>).</p>
<p><strong>LFS</strong> The Large File Summit specification, completed in 1996. This specification defined mechanisms that allowed 32-bit systems to support the use of large files (i.e., 64-bit file offsets). See <a href="https://www.opengroup.org/platform/lfs.html"></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POSIX.1-1988</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This was the first POSIX standard, ratified by IEEE as IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, and subsequently adopted (with minor revisions) as an ISO standard in 1990. The term "POSIX" was coined by Richard Stallman.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POSIX.1-1990</strong></dt>
<dd><p>"Portable Operating System Interface for Computing Environments". IEEE 1003.1-1990 part 1, ratified by ISO in 1990 (<em>ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990</em>).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POSIX.2</strong></dt>
<dd><p>IEEE Std 1003.2-1992, describing commands and utilities, ratified by ISO in 1993 (<em>ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993</em>).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POSIX.1b</strong> (formerly known as <em>POSIX.4</em>)</dt>
<dd><p>IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993, describing real-time facilities for portable operating systems, ratified by ISO in 1996 (<em>ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996</em>).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POSIX.1c (formerly known as <em>POSIX.4a</em>)</strong></dt>
<dd><p>IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995, which describes the POSIX threads interfaces.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POSIX.1d</strong></dt>
<dd><p>IEEE Std 1003.1c-1999, which describes additional real-time extensions.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POSIX.1g</strong></dt>
<dd><p>IEEE Std 1003.1g-2000, which describes networking APIs (including sockets).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POSIX.1j</strong></dt>
<dd><p>IEEE Std 1003.1j-2000, which describes advanced real-time extensions.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POSIX.1-1996</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A 1996 revision of POSIX.1 which incorporated POSIX.1b and POSIX.1c.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>XPG3</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Released in 1989, this was the first release of the X/Open Portability Guide to be based on a POSIX standard (POSIX.1-1988). This multivolume guide was developed by the X/Open Group, a multivendor consortium.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>XPG4</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A revision of the X/Open Portability Guide, released in 1992. This revision incorporated POSIX.2.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>XPG4v2</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A 1994 revision of XPG4. This is also referred to as <em>Spec 1170</em>, where 1170 referred to the number of interfaces defined by this standard.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SUS (SUSv1)</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Single UNIX Specification. This was a repackaging of XPG4v2 and other X/Open standards (X/Open Curses Issue 4 version 2, X/Open Networking Service (XNS) Issue 4). Systems conforming to this standard can be branded <em>UNIX 95</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SUSv2</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Single UNIX Specification version 2. Sometimes also referred to (incorrectly) as <em>XPG5</em>. This standard appeared in 1997. Systems conforming to this standard can be branded <em>UNIX 98</em>. See also <a href="http://www.unix.org/version2/"></a>.)</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POSIX.1-2001, SUSv3</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This was a 2001 revision and consolidation of the POSIX.1, POSIX.2, and SUS standards into a single document, conducted under the auspices of the Austin Group <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/"></a>. The standard is available online at <a href="http://www.unix.org/version3/"></a>.</p>
<p>The standard defines two levels of conformance: <em>POSIX conformance</em>, which is a baseline set of interfaces required of a conforming system; and <em>XSI Conformance</em>, which additionally mandates a set of interfaces (the "XSI extension") which are only optional for POSIX conformance. XSI-conformant systems can be branded <em>UNIX 03</em>.</p>
<p>The POSIX.1-2001 document is broken into four parts:</p>
<p><strong>XBD</strong>: Definitions, terms and concepts, header file specifications.</p>
<p><strong>XSH</strong>: Specifications of functions (i.e., system calls and library functions in actual implementations).</p>
<p><strong>XCU</strong>: Specifications of commands and utilities (i.e., the area formerly described by POSIX.2).</p>
<p><strong>XRAT</strong>: Informative text on the other parts of the standard.</p>
<p>POSIX.1-2001 is aligned with C99, so that all of the library functions standardized in C99 are also standardized in POSIX.1-2001.</p>
<p>The Single UNIX Specification version 3 (SUSv3) comprises the Base Specifications containing XBD, XSH, XCU, and XRAT as above, plus X/Open Curses Issue 4 version 2 as an extra volume that is not in POSIX.1-2001.</p>
<p>Two Technical Corrigenda (minor fixes and improvements) of the original 2001 standard have occurred: TC1 in 2003 and TC2 in 2004.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POSIX.1-2008, SUSv4</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Work on the next revision of POSIX.1/SUS was completed and ratified in 2008. The standard is available online at <a href="http://www.unix.org/version4/"></a>.</p>
<p>The changes in this revision are not as large as those that occurred for POSIX.1-2001/SUSv3, but a number of new interfaces are added and various details of existing specifications are modified. Many of the interfaces that were optional in POSIX.1-2001 become mandatory in the 2008 revision of the standard. A few interfaces that are present in POSIX.1-2001 are marked as obsolete in POSIX.1-2008, or removed from the standard altogether.</p>
<p>The revised standard is structured in the same way as its predecessor. The Single UNIX Specification version 4 (SUSv4) comprises the Base Specifications containing XBD, XSH, XCU, and XRAT, plus X/Open Curses Issue 7 as an extra volume that is not in POSIX.1-2008.</p>
<p>Again there are two levels of conformance: the baseline <em>POSIX Conformance</em>, and <em>XSI Conformance</em>, which mandates an additional set of interfaces beyond those in the base specification.</p>
<p>In general, where the CONFORMING TO section of a manual page lists POSIX.1-2001, it can be assumed that the interface also conforms to POSIX.1-2008, unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>Technical Corrigendum 1 (minor fixes and improvements) of this standard was released in 2013.</p>
<p>Technical Corrigendum 2 of this standard was released in 2016.</p>

</dd>
<dt><strong>SUSv4 2016 edition</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is equivalent to POSIX.1-2008, with the addition of Technical Corrigenda 1 and 2 and the XCurses specification.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POSIX.1-2017</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This revision of POSIX is technically identical to POSIX.1-2008 with Technical Corrigenda 1 and 2 applied.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SUSv4 2018 edition</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is equivalent to POSIX.1-2017, with the addition of the XCurses specification.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The interfaces documented in POSIX.1/SUS are available as manual pages under sections 0p (header files), 1p (commands), and 3p (functions); thus one can write "man 3p open".</p>
