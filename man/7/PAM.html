<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>PAM, pam - Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This manual is intended to offer a quick introduction to <strong>Linux-PAM</strong>. For more information the reader is directed to the <strong>Linux-PAM system administrators guide</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Linux-PAM</strong> is a system of libraries that handle the authentication tasks of applications (services) on the system. The library provides a stable general interface (Application Programming Interface - API) that privilege granting programs (such as <strong>login</strong>(1) and <strong>su</strong>(1)) defer to to perform standard authentication tasks.</p>
<p>The principal feature of the PAM approach is that the nature of the authentication is dynamically configurable. In other words, the system administrator is free to choose how individual service-providing applications will authenticate users. This dynamic configuration is set by the contents of the single <strong>Linux-PAM</strong> configuration file /etc/pam.conf. Alternatively, the configuration can be set by individual configuration files located in the /etc/pam.d/ directory. The presence of this directory will cause <strong>Linux-PAM</strong> to <em>ignore</em> /etc/pam.conf.</p>
<p>Vendor-supplied PAM configuration files might be installed in the system directory /usr/lib/pam.d/ or a configurable vendor specific directory instead of the machine configuration directory /etc/pam.d/. If no machine configuration file is found, the vendor-supplied file is used. All files in /etc/pam.d/ override files with the same name in other directories.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the system administrator, for whom this manual is provided, it is not of primary importance to understand the internal behavior of the <strong>Linux-PAM</strong> library. The important point to recognize is that the configuration file(s) <em>define</em> the connection between applications (<strong>services</strong>) and the pluggable authentication modules (<strong>PAM</strong>s) that perform the actual authentication tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Linux-PAM</strong> separates the tasks of <em>authentication</em> into four independent management groups: <strong>account</strong> management; <strong>auth</strong>entication management; <strong>password</strong> management; and <strong>session</strong> management. (We highlight the abbreviations used for these groups in the configuration file.)</p>
<p>Simply put, these groups take care of different aspects of a typical users request for a restricted service:</p>
<p><strong>account</strong> - provide account verification types of service: has the users password expired?; is this user permitted access to the requested service?</p>
<p><strong>auth</strong>entication - authenticate a user and set up user credentials. Typically this is via some challenge-response request that the user must satisfy: if you are who you claim to be please enter your password. Not all authentications are of this type, there exist hardware based authentication schemes (such as the use of smart-cards and biometric devices), with suitable modules, these may be substituted seamlessly for more standard approaches to authentication - such is the flexibility of <strong>Linux-PAM</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>password</strong> - this groups responsibility is the task of updating authentication mechanisms. Typically, such services are strongly coupled to those of the <strong>auth</strong> group. Some authentication mechanisms lend themselves well to being updated with such a function. Standard UN*X password-based access is the obvious example: please enter a replacement password.</p>
<p><strong>session</strong> - this group of tasks cover things that should be done prior to a service being given and after it is withdrawn. Such tasks include the maintenance of audit trails and the mounting of the users home directory. The <strong>session</strong> management group is important as it provides both an opening and closing hook for modules to affect the services available to a user.</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<p>/etc/pam.conf</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the configuration file</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/etc/pam.d</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the <strong>Linux-PAM</strong> configuration directory. Generally, if this directory is present, the /etc/pam.conf file is ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/usr/lib/pam.d</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the <strong>Linux-PAM</strong> vendor configuration directory. Files in /etc/pam.d override files with the same name in this directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt;vendordir&gt;/pam.d</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the <strong>Linux-PAM</strong> vendor configuration directory. Files in /etc/pam.d and /usr/lib/pam.d override files with the same name in this directory. Only available if Linux-PAM was compiled with vendordir enabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>
<p>Typically errors generated by the <strong>Linux-PAM</strong> system of libraries, will be written to <strong>syslog</strong>(3).</p>
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>DCE-RFC 86.0, October 1995. Contains additional features, but remains backwardly compatible with this RFC.</p>
