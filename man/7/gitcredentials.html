<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>gitcredentials - Providing usernames and passwords to Git</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>git config credential.https://example.com.username myusername
git config credential.helper &quot;$helper $options&quot;</code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Git will sometimes need credentials from the user in order to perform operations; for example, it may need to ask for a username and password in order to access a remote repository over HTTP. This manual describes the mechanisms Git uses to request these credentials, as well as some features to avoid inputting these credentials repeatedly.</p>
<h1>REQUESTING CREDENTIALS</h1>
<p>Without any credential helpers defined, Git will try the following strategies to ask the user for usernames and passwords:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.</p>
<p>If the <strong>GIT_ASKPASS</strong> environment variable is set, the program specified by the variable is invoked. A suitable prompt is provided to the program on the command line, and the userâ€™s input is read from its standard output.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if the <strong>core.askPass</strong> configuration variable is set, its value is used as above.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if the <strong>SSH_ASKPASS</strong> environment variable is set, its value is used as above.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the user is prompted on the terminal.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>AVOIDING REPETITION</h1>
<p>It can be cumbersome to input the same credentials over and over. Git provides two methods to reduce this annoyance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.</p>
<p>Static configuration of usernames for a given authentication context.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Credential helpers to cache or store passwords, or to interact with a system password wallet or keychain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first is simple and appropriate if you do not have secure storage available for a password. It is generally configured by adding this to your config:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[credential &quot;https://example.com&quot;]
        username = me</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Credential helpers, on the other hand, are external programs from which Git can request both usernames and passwords; they typically interface with secure storage provided by the OS or other programs.</p>
<p>To use a helper, you must first select one to use. Git currently includes the following helpers:</p>
<p>cache</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cache credentials in memory for a short period of time. See <strong>git-credential-cache</strong>(1) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>store</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Store credentials indefinitely on disk. See <strong>git-credential-store</strong>(1) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may also have third-party helpers installed; search for <strong>credential-*</strong> in the output of <strong>git help -a</strong>, and consult the documentation of individual helpers. Once you have selected a helper, you can tell Git to use it by putting its name into the credential.helper variable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.</p>
<p>Find a helper.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ git help -a | grep credential-
credential-foo</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Read its description.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ git help credential-foo</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Tell Git to use it.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ git config --global credential.helper foo</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h1>CREDENTIAL CONTEXTS</h1>
<p>Git considers each credential to have a context defined by a URL. This context is used to look up context-specific configuration, and is passed to any helpers, which may use it as an index into secure storage.</p>
<p>For instance, imagine we are accessing <strong>https://example.com/foo.git</strong>. When Git looks into a config file to see if a section matches this context, it will consider the two a match if the context is a more-specific subset of the pattern in the config file. For example, if you have this in your config file:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[credential &quot;https://example.com&quot;]
        username = foo</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>then we will match: both protocols are the same, both hosts are the same, and the "pattern" URL does not care about the path component at all. However, this context would not match:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[credential &quot;https://kernel.org&quot;]
        username = foo</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>because the hostnames differ. Nor would it match <strong>foo.example.com</strong>; Git compares hostnames exactly, without considering whether two hosts are part of the same domain. Likewise, a config entry for <strong>http://example.com</strong> would not match: Git compares the protocols exactly. However, you may use wildcards in the domain name and other pattern matching techniques as with the <strong>http.&lt;url&gt;.*</strong> options.</p>
<p>If the "pattern" URL does include a path component, then this too must match exactly: the context <strong>https://example.com/bar/baz.git</strong> will match a config entry for <strong>https://example.com/bar/baz.git</strong> (in addition to matching the config entry for <strong>https://example.com</strong>) but will not match a config entry for <strong>https://example.com/bar</strong>.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</h1>
<p>Options for a credential context can be configured either in <strong>credential.*</strong> (which applies to all credentials), or <strong>credential.&lt;url&gt;.*</strong>, where &lt;url&gt; matches the context as described above.</p>
<p>The following options are available in either location:</p>
<p>helper</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The name of an external credential helper, and any associated options. If the helper name is not an absolute path, then the string <strong>git credential-</strong> is prepended. The resulting string is executed by the shell (so, for example, setting this to <strong>foo --option=bar</strong> will execute <strong>git credential-foo --option=bar</strong> via the shell. See the manual of specific helpers for examples of their use.</p>
<p>If there are multiple instances of the <strong>credential.helper</strong> configuration variable, each helper will be tried in turn, and may provide a username, password, or nothing. Once Git has acquired both a username and a password, no more helpers will be tried.</p>
<p>If <strong>credential.helper</strong> is configured to the empty string, this resets the helper list to empty (so you may override a helper set by a lower-priority config file by configuring the empty-string helper, followed by whatever set of helpers you would like).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>username</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A default username, if one is not provided in the URL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>useHttpPath</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, Git does not consider the "path" component of an http URL to be worth matching via external helpers. This means that a credential stored for <strong>https://example.com/foo.git</strong> will also be used for <strong>https://example.com/bar.git</strong>. If you do want to distinguish these cases, set this option to <strong>true</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>CUSTOM HELPERS</h1>
<p>You can write your own custom helpers to interface with any system in which you keep credentials.</p>
<p>Credential helpers are programs executed by Git to fetch or save credentials from and to long-term storage (where "long-term" is simply longer than a single Git process; e.g., credentials may be stored in-memory for a few minutes, or indefinitely on disk).</p>
<p>Each helper is specified by a single string in the configuration variable <strong>credential.helper</strong> (and others, see <strong>git-config</strong>(1)). The string is transformed by Git into a command to be executed using these rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.</p>
<p>If the helper string begins with "!", it is considered a shell snippet, and everything after the "!" becomes the command.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if the helper string begins with an absolute path, the verbatim helper string becomes the command.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the string "git credential-" is prepended to the helper string, and the result becomes the command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The resulting command then has an "operation" argument appended to it (see below for details), and the result is executed by the shell.</p>
<p>Here are some example specifications:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># run &quot;git credential-foo&quot;
[credential]
        helper = foo

# same as above, but pass an argument to the helper
[credential]
        helper = &quot;foo --bar=baz&quot;

# the arguments are parsed by the shell, so use shell
# quoting if necessary
[credential]
        helper = &quot;foo --bar=whitespace arg&quot;

# you can also use an absolute path, which will not use the git wrapper
[credential]
        helper = &quot;/path/to/my/helper --with-arguments&quot;

# or you can specify your own shell snippet
[credential &quot;https://example.com&quot;]
        username = your_user
        helper = &quot;!f() { test \&quot;$1\&quot; = get &amp;&amp; echo \&quot;password=$(cat $HOME/.secret)\&quot;; }; f&quot;</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally speaking, rule (3) above is the simplest for users to specify. Authors of credential helpers should make an effort to assist their users by naming their program "git-credential-$NAME", and putting it in the <strong>$PATH</strong> or <strong>$GIT_EXEC_PATH</strong> during installation, which will allow a user to enable it with <strong>git config credential.helper $NAME</strong>.</p>
<p>When a helper is executed, it will have one "operation" argument appended to its command line, which is one of:</p>
<p><strong>get</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return a matching credential, if any exists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>store</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Store the credential, if applicable to the helper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>erase</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remove a matching credential, if any, from the helperâ€™s storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The details of the credential will be provided on the helperâ€™s stdin stream. The exact format is the same as the input/output format of the <strong>git credential</strong> plumbing command (see the section <strong>INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT</strong> in <strong>git-credential</strong>(1) for a detailed specification).</p>
<p>For a <strong>get</strong> operation, the helper should produce a list of attributes on stdout in the same format (see <strong>git-credential</strong>(1) for common attributes). A helper is free to produce a subset, or even no values at all if it has nothing useful to provide. Any provided attributes will overwrite those already known about by Gitâ€™s credential subsystem.</p>
<p>While it is possible to override all attributes, well behaving helpers should refrain from doing so for any attribute other than username and password.</p>
<p>If a helper outputs a <strong>quit</strong> attribute with a value of <strong>true</strong> or <strong>1</strong>, no further helpers will be consulted, nor will the user be prompted (if no credential has been provided, the operation will then fail).</p>
<p>Similarly, no more helpers will be consulted once both username and password had been provided.</p>
<p>For a <strong>store</strong> or <strong>erase</strong> operation, the helperâ€™s output is ignored.</p>
<p>If a helper fails to perform the requested operation or needs to notify the user of a potential issue, it may write to stderr.</p>
<p>If it does not support the requested operation (e.g., a read-only store), it should silently ignore the request.</p>
<p>If a helper receives any other operation, it should silently ignore the request. This leaves room for future operations to be added (older helpers will just ignore the new requests).</p>
