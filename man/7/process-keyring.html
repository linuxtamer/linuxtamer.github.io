<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>process-keyring - per-process shared keyring</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The process keyring is a keyring used to anchor keys on behalf of a process. It is created only when a process requests it. The process keyring has the name (description) <em>_pid</em>.</p>
<p>A special serial number value, <strong>KEY_SPEC_PROCESS_KEYRING</strong>, is defined that can be used in lieu of the actual serial number of the calling process's process keyring.</p>
<p>From the <strong>keyctl</strong>(1) utility, '<strong>@p</strong>' can be used instead of a numeric key ID in much the same way, but since <strong>keyctl</strong>(1) is a program run after forking, this is of no utility.</p>
<p>A thread created using the <strong>clone</strong>(2) <strong>CLONE_THREAD</strong> flag has the same process keyring as the caller of <strong>clone</strong>(2). When a new process is created using <strong>fork</strong>() it initially has no process keyring. A process's process keyring is cleared on <strong>execve</strong>(2). The process keyring is destroyed when the last thread that refers to it terminates.</p>
<p>If a process doesn't have a process keyring when it is accessed, then the process keyring will be created if the keyring is to be modified; otherwise, the error <strong>ENOKEY</strong> results.</p>
