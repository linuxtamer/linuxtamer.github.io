<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>bio - Basic I/O abstraction</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>#include &lt;openssl/bio.h&gt;</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>A BIO is an I/O abstraction, it hides many of the underlying I/O details from an application. If an application uses a BIO for its I/O it can transparently handle SSL connections, unencrypted network connections and file I/O.</p>
<p>There are two type of BIO, a source/sink BIO and a filter BIO.</p>
<p>As its name implies a source/sink BIO is a source and/or sink of data, examples include a socket BIO and a file BIO.</p>
<p>A filter BIO takes data from one BIO and passes it through to another, or the application. The data may be left unmodified (for example a message digest BIO) or translated (for example an encryption BIO). The effect of a filter BIO may change according to the I/O operation it is performing: for example an encryption BIO will encrypt data if it is being written to and decrypt data if it is being read from.</p>
<p>BIOs can be joined together to form a chain (a single BIO is a chain with one component). A chain normally consist of one source/sink BIO and one or more filter BIOs. Data read from or written to the first BIO then traverses the chain to the end (normally a source/sink BIO).</p>
<p>Some BIOs (such as memory BIOs) can be used immediately after calling <strong>BIO_new()</strong>. Others (such as file BIOs) need some additional initialization, and frequently a utility function exists to create and initialize such BIOs.</p>
<p>If <strong>BIO_free()</strong> is called on a BIO chain it will only free one BIO resulting in a memory leak.</p>
<p>Calling <strong>BIO_free_all()</strong> on a single BIO has the same effect as calling <strong>BIO_free()</strong> on it other than the discarded return value.</p>
<p>Normally the <strong>type</strong> argument is supplied by a function which returns a pointer to a BIO_METHOD. There is a naming convention for such functions: a source/sink BIO is normally called BIO_s_*() and a filter BIO BIO_f_*();</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Create a memory BIO:</p>
<p>BIO *mem = BIO_new(BIO_s_mem());</p>
