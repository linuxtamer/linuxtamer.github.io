<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>thread-keyring - per-thread keyring</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The thread keyring is a keyring used to anchor keys on behalf of a process. It is created only when a thread requests it. The thread keyring has the name (description) <em>_tid</em>.</p>
<p>A special serial number value, <strong>KEY_SPEC_THREAD_KEYRING</strong>, is defined that can be used in lieu of the actual serial number of the calling thread's thread keyring.</p>
<p>From the <strong>keyctl</strong>(1) utility, '<strong>@t</strong>' can be used instead of a numeric key ID in much the same way, but as <strong>keyctl</strong>(1) is a program run after forking, this is of no utility.</p>
<p>Thread keyrings are not inherited across <strong>clone</strong>(2) and <strong>fork</strong>(2) and are cleared by <strong>execve</strong>(2). A thread keyring is destroyed when the thread that refers to it terminates.</p>
<p>Initially, a thread does not have a thread keyring. If a thread doesn't have a thread keyring when it is accessed, then it will be created if it is to be modified; otherwise the operation fails with the error <strong>ENOKEY</strong>.</p>
