<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>prctl - operations on a process or thread</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;sys/prctl.h&gt;

int prctl(int option, unsigned long arg2, unsigned long arg3,
 unsigned long arg4, unsigned long arg5);</code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>prctl</strong>() manipulates various aspects of the behavior of the calling thread or process.</p>
<p>Note that careless use of some <strong>prctl</strong>() operations can confuse the user-space run-time environment, so these operations should be used with care.</p>
<p><strong>prctl</strong>() is called with a first argument describing what to do (with values defined in <em>&lt;linux/prctl.h&gt;</em>), and further arguments with a significance depending on the first one. The first argument can be:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>PR_CAP_AMBIENT</strong> (since Linux 4.3)</dt>
<dd><p>Reads or changes the ambient capability set of the calling thread, according to the value of <em>arg2</em>, which must be one of the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>PR_CAP_AMBIENT_RAISE</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The capability specified in <em>arg3</em> is added to the ambient set. The specified capability must already be present in both the permitted and the inheritable sets of the process. This operation is not permitted if the <strong>SECBIT_NO_CAP_AMBIENT_RAISE</strong> securebit is set.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_CAP_AMBIENT_LOWER</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The capability specified in <em>arg3</em> is removed from the ambient set.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_CAP_AMBIENT_IS_SET</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The <strong>prctl</strong>() call returns 1 if the capability in <em>arg3</em> is in the ambient set and 0 if it is not.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_CAP_AMBIENT_CLEAR_ALL</strong></dt>
<dd><p>All capabilities will be removed from the ambient set. This operation requires setting <em>arg3</em> to zero.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In all of the above operations, <em>arg4</em> and <em>arg5</em> must be specified as 0.</p>
<p>Higher-level interfaces layered on top of the above operations are provided in the <strong>libcap</strong>(3) library in the form of <strong>cap_get_ambient</strong>(3), <strong>cap_set_ambient</strong>(3), and <strong>cap_reset_ambient</strong>(3).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_CAPBSET_READ</strong> (since Linux 2.6.25)</dt>
<dd><p>Return (as the function result) 1 if the capability specified in <em>arg2</em> is in the calling thread's capability bounding set, or 0 if it is not. (The capability constants are defined in <em>&lt;linux/capability.h&gt;</em>.) The capability bounding set dictates whether the process can receive the capability through a file's permitted capability set on a subsequent call to <strong>execve</strong>(2).</p>
<p>If the capability specified in <em>arg2</em> is not valid, then the call fails with the error <strong>EINVAL</strong>.</p>
<p>A higher-level interface layered on top of this operation is provided in the <strong>libcap</strong>(3) library in the form of <strong>cap_get_bound</strong>(3).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_CAPBSET_DROP</strong> (since Linux 2.6.25)</dt>
<dd><p>If the calling thread has the <strong>CAP_SETPCAP</strong> capability within its user namespace, then drop the capability specified by <em>arg2</em> from the calling thread's capability bounding set. Any children of the calling thread will inherit the newly reduced bounding set.</p>
<p>The call fails with the error: <strong>EPERM</strong> if the calling thread does not have the <strong>CAP_SETPCAP</strong>; <strong>EINVAL</strong> if <em>arg2</em> does not represent a valid capability; or <strong>EINVAL</strong> if file capabilities are not enabled in the kernel, in which case bounding sets are not supported.</p>
<p>A higher-level interface layered on top of this operation is provided in the <strong>libcap</strong>(3) library in the form of <strong>cap_drop_bound</strong>(3).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER</strong> (since Linux 3.4)</dt>
<dd><p>If <em>arg2</em> is nonzero, set the "child subreaper" attribute of the calling process; if <em>arg2</em> is zero, unset the attribute.</p>
<p>A subreaper fulfills the role of <strong>init</strong>(1) for its descendant processes. When a process becomes orphaned (i.e., its immediate parent terminates), then that process will be reparented to the nearest still living ancestor subreaper. Subsequently, calls to <strong>getppid</strong>(2) in the orphaned process will now return the PID of the subreaper process, and when the orphan terminates, it is the subreaper process that will receive a <strong>SIGCHLD</strong> signal and will be able to <strong>wait</strong>(2) on the process to discover its termination status.</p>
<p>The setting of the "child subreaper" attribute is not inherited by children created by <strong>fork</strong>(2) and <strong>clone</strong>(2). The setting is preserved across <strong>execve</strong>(2).</p>
<p>Establishing a subreaper process is useful in session management frameworks where a hierarchical group of processes is managed by a subreaper process that needs to be informed when one of the processes—for example, a double-forked daemon—terminates (perhaps so that it can restart that process). Some <strong>init</strong>(1) frameworks (e.g., <strong>systemd</strong>(1)) employ a subreaper process for similar reasons.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_GET_CHILD_SUBREAPER</strong> (since Linux 3.4)</dt>
<dd><p>Return the "child subreaper" setting of the caller, in the location pointed to by <em>(int *) arg2</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_DUMPABLE</strong> (since Linux 2.3.20)</dt>
<dd><p>Set the state of the "dumpable" attribute, which determines whether core dumps are produced for the calling process upon delivery of a signal whose default behavior is to produce a core dump.</p>
<p>In kernels up to and including 2.6.12, <em>arg2</em> must be either 0 (<strong>SUID_DUMP_DISABLE</strong>, process is not dumpable) or 1 (<strong>SUID_DUMP_USER</strong>, process is dumpable). Between kernels 2.6.13 and 2.6.17, the value 2 was also permitted, which caused any binary which normally would not be dumped to be dumped readable by root only; for security reasons, this feature has been removed. (See also the description of <em>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</em> in <strong>proc</strong>(5).)</p>
<p>Normally, the "dumpable" attribute is set to 1. However, it is reset to the current value contained in the file <em>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</em> (which by default has the value 0), in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The process's effective user or group ID is changed.</p></li>
<li><p>The process's filesystem user or group ID is changed (see <strong>credentials</strong>(7)).</p></li>
<li><p>The process executes (<strong>execve</strong>(2)) a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program, resulting in a change of either the effective user ID or the effective group ID.</p></li>
<li><p>The process executes (<strong>execve</strong>(2)) a program that has file capabilities (see <strong>capabilities</strong>(7)), but only if the permitted capabilities gained exceed those already permitted for the process.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Processes that are not dumpable can not be attached via <strong>ptrace</strong>(2) <strong>PTRACE_ATTACH</strong>; see <strong>ptrace</strong>(2) for further details.</p>
<p>If a process is not dumpable, the ownership of files in the process's <em>/proc/[pid]</em> directory is affected as described in <strong>proc</strong>(5).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_GET_DUMPABLE</strong> (since Linux 2.3.20)</dt>
<dd><p>Return (as the function result) the current state of the calling process's dumpable attribute.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_ENDIAN</strong> (since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)</dt>
<dd><p>Set the endian-ness of the calling process to the value given in <em>arg2</em>, which should be one of the following: <strong>PR_ENDIAN_BIG</strong>, <strong>PR_ENDIAN_LITTLE</strong>, or <strong>PR_ENDIAN_PPC_LITTLE</strong> (PowerPC pseudo little endian).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_GET_ENDIAN</strong> (since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)</dt>
<dd><p>Return the endian-ness of the calling process, in the location pointed to by <em>(int *) arg2</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_FP_MODE</strong> (since Linux 4.0, only on MIPS)</dt>
<dd><p>On the MIPS architecture, user-space code can be built using an ABI which permits linking with code that has more restrictive floating-point (FP) requirements. For example, user-space code may be built to target the O32 FPXX ABI and linked with code built for either one of the more restrictive FP32 or FP64 ABIs. When more restrictive code is linked in, the overall requirement for the process is to use the more restrictive floating-point mode.</p>
<p>Because the kernel has no means of knowing in advance which mode the process should be executed in, and because these restrictions can change over the lifetime of the process, the <strong>PR_SET_FP_MODE</strong> operation is provided to allow control of the floating-point mode from user space.</p>
<p>The <em>(unsigned int) arg2</em> argument is a bit mask describing the floating-point mode used:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>PR_FP_MODE_FR</strong></dt>
<dd><p>When this bit is <em>unset</em> (so called <strong>FR=0</strong> or <strong>FR0</strong> mode), the 32 floating-point registers are 32 bits wide, and 64-bit registers are represented as a pair of registers (even- and odd- numbered, with the even-numbered register containing the lower 32 bits, and the odd-numbered register containing the higher 32 bits).</p>
<p>When this bit is <em>set</em> (on supported hardware), the 32 floating-point registers are 64 bits wide (so called <strong>FR=1</strong> or <strong>FR1</strong> mode). Note that modern MIPS implementations (MIPS R6 and newer) support <strong>FR=1</strong> mode only.</p>
<p>Applications that use the O32 FP32 ABI can operate only when this bit is <em>unset</em> (<strong>FR=0</strong>; or they can be used with FRE enabled, see below). Applications that use the O32 FP64 ABI (and the O32 FP64A ABI, which exists to provide the ability to operate with existing FP32 code; see below) can operate only when this bit is <em>set</em> (<strong>FR=1</strong>). Applications that use the O32 FPXX ABI can operate with either <strong>FR=0</strong> or <strong>FR=1</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_FP_MODE_FRE</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Enable emulation of 32-bit floating-point mode. When this mode is enabled, it emulates 32-bit floating-point operations by raising a reserved-instruction exception on every instruction that uses 32-bit formats and the kernel then handles the instruction in software. (The problem lies in the discrepancy of handling odd-numbered registers which are the high 32 bits of 64-bit registers with even numbers in <strong>FR=0</strong> mode and the lower 32-bit parts of odd-numbered 64-bit registers in <strong>FR=1</strong> mode.) Enabling this bit is necessary when code with the O32 FP32 ABI should operate with code with compatible the O32 FPXX or O32 FP64A ABIs (which require <strong>FR=1</strong> FPU mode) or when it is executed on newer hardware (MIPS R6 onwards) which lacks <strong>FR=0</strong> mode support when a binary with the FP32 ABI is used.</p>
<p>Note that this mode makes sense only when the FPU is in 64-bit mode (<strong>FR=1</strong>).</p>
<p>Note that the use of emulation inherently has a significant performance hit and should be avoided if possible.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the N32/N64 ABI, 64-bit floating-point mode is always used, so FPU emulation is not required and the FPU always operates in <strong>FR=1</strong> mode.</p>
<p>This option is mainly intended for use by the dynamic linker (<strong>ld.so</strong>(8)).</p>
<p>The arguments <em>arg3</em>, <em>arg4</em>, and <em>arg5</em> are ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_GET_FP_MODE</strong> (since Linux 4.0, only on MIPS)</dt>
<dd><p>Return (as the function result) the current floating-point mode (see the description of <strong>PR_SET_FP_MODE</strong> for details).</p>
<p>On success, the call returns a bit mask which represents the current floating-point mode.</p>
<p>The arguments <em>arg2</em>, <em>arg3</em>, <em>arg4</em>, and <em>arg5</em> are ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_FPEMU</strong> (since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)</dt>
<dd><p>Set floating-point emulation control bits to <em>arg2</em>. Pass <strong>PR_FPEMU_NOPRINT</strong> to silently emulate floating-point operation accesses, or <strong>PR_FPEMU_SIGFPE</strong> to not emulate floating-point operations and send <strong>SIGFPE</strong> instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_GET_FPEMU</strong> (since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)</dt>
<dd><p>Return floating-point emulation control bits, in the location pointed to by <em>(int *) arg2</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_FPEXC</strong> (since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)</dt>
<dd><p>Set floating-point exception mode to <em>arg2</em>. Pass <strong>PR_FP_EXC_SW_ENABLE</strong> to use FPEXC for FP exception enables, <strong>PR_FP_EXC_DIV</strong> for floating-point divide by zero, <strong>PR_FP_EXC_OVF</strong> for floating-point overflow, <strong>PR_FP_EXC_UND</strong> for floating-point underflow, <strong>PR_FP_EXC_RES</strong> for floating-point inexact result, <strong>PR_FP_EXC_INV</strong> for floating-point invalid operation, <strong>PR_FP_EXC_DISABLED</strong> for FP exceptions disabled, <strong>PR_FP_EXC_NONRECOV</strong> for async nonrecoverable exception mode, <strong>PR_FP_EXC_ASYNC</strong> for async recoverable exception mode, <strong>PR_FP_EXC_PRECISE</strong> for precise exception mode.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_GET_FPEXC</strong> (since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)</dt>
<dd><p>Return floating-point exception mode, in the location pointed to by <em>(int *) arg2</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_IO_FLUSHER</strong> (since Linux 5.6)</dt>
<dd><p>If a user process is involved in the block layer or filesystem I/O path, and can allocate memory while processing I/O requests it must set <em>arg2</em> to 1. This will put the process in the IO_FLUSHER state, which allows it special treatment to make progress when allocating memory. If <em>arg2</em> is 0, the process will clear the IO_FLUSHER state, and the default behavior will be used.</p>
<p>The calling process must have the <strong>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</strong> capability.</p>
<p><em>arg3</em>, <em>arg4</em>, and <em>arg5</em> must be zero.</p>
<p>The IO_FLUSHER state is inherited by a child process created via <strong>fork</strong>(2) and is preserved across <strong>execve</strong>(2).</p>
<p>Examples of IO_FLUSHER applications are FUSE daemons, SCSI device emulation daemons, and daemons that perform error handling like multipath path recovery applications.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_GET_IO_FLUSHER (Since Linux 5.6)</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Return (as the function result) the IO_FLUSHER state of the caller. A value of 1 indicates that the caller is in the IO_FLUSHER state; 0 indicates that the caller is not in the IO_FLUSHER state.</p>
<p>The calling process must have the <strong>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</strong> capability.</p>
<p><em>arg2</em>, <em>arg3</em>, <em>arg4</em>, and <em>arg5</em> must be zero.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_KEEPCAPS</strong> (since Linux 2.2.18)</dt>
<dd><p>Set the state of the calling thread's "keep capabilities" flag. The effect of this flag is described in <strong>capabilities</strong>(7). <em>arg2</em> must be either 0 (clear the flag) or 1 (set the flag). The "keep capabilities" value will be reset to 0 on subsequent calls to <strong>execve</strong>(2).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_GET_KEEPCAPS</strong> (since Linux 2.2.18)</dt>
<dd><p>Return (as the function result) the current state of the calling thread's "keep capabilities" flag. See <strong>capabilities</strong>(7) for a description of this flag.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_MCE_KILL</strong> (since Linux 2.6.32)</dt>
<dd><p>Set the machine check memory corruption kill policy for the calling thread. If <em>arg2</em> is <strong>PR_MCE_KILL_CLEAR</strong>, clear the thread memory corruption kill policy and use the system-wide default. (The system-wide default is defined by <em>/proc/sys/vm/memory_failure_early_kill</em>; see <strong>proc</strong>(5).) If <em>arg2</em> is <strong>PR_MCE_KILL_SET</strong>, use a thread-specific memory corruption kill policy. In this case, <em>arg3</em> defines whether the policy is <em>early kill</em> (<strong>PR_MCE_KILL_EARLY</strong>), <em>late kill</em> (<strong>PR_MCE_KILL_LATE</strong>), or the system-wide default (<strong>PR_MCE_KILL_DEFAULT</strong>). Early kill means that the thread receives a <strong>SIGBUS</strong> signal as soon as hardware memory corruption is detected inside its address space. In late kill mode, the process is killed only when it accesses a corrupted page. See <strong>sigaction</strong>(2) for more information on the <strong>SIGBUS</strong> signal. The policy is inherited by children. The remaining unused <strong>prctl</strong>() arguments must be zero for future compatibility.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_MCE_KILL_GET</strong> (since Linux 2.6.32)</dt>
<dd><p>Return (as the function result) the current per-process machine check kill policy. All unused <strong>prctl</strong>() arguments must be zero.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_MM</strong> (since Linux 3.3)</dt>
<dd><p>Modify certain kernel memory map descriptor fields of the calling process. Usually these fields are set by the kernel and dynamic loader (see <strong>ld.so</strong>(8) for more information) and a regular application should not use this feature. However, there are cases, such as self-modifying programs, where a program might find it useful to change its own memory map.</p>
<p>The calling process must have the <strong>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</strong> capability. The value in <em>arg2</em> is one of the options below, while <em>arg3</em> provides a new value for the option. The <em>arg4</em> and <em>arg5</em> arguments must be zero if unused.</p>
<p>Before Linux 3.10, this feature is available only if the kernel is built with the <strong>CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE</strong> option enabled.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_MM_START_CODE</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Set the address above which the program text can run. The corresponding memory area must be readable and executable, but not writable or shareable (see <strong>mprotect</strong>(2) and <strong>mmap</strong>(2) for more information).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_MM_END_CODE</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Set the address below which the program text can run. The corresponding memory area must be readable and executable, but not writable or shareable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_MM_START_DATA</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Set the address above which initialized and uninitialized (bss) data are placed. The corresponding memory area must be readable and writable, but not executable or shareable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_MM_END_DATA</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Set the address below which initialized and uninitialized (bss) data are placed. The corresponding memory area must be readable and writable, but not executable or shareable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_MM_START_STACK</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Set the start address of the stack. The corresponding memory area must be readable and writable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_MM_START_BRK</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Set the address above which the program heap can be expanded with <strong>brk</strong>(2) call. The address must be greater than the ending address of the current program data segment. In addition, the combined size of the resulting heap and the size of the data segment can't exceed the <strong>RLIMIT_DATA</strong> resource limit (see <strong>setrlimit</strong>(2)).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_MM_BRK</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Set the current <strong>brk</strong>(2) value. The requirements for the address are the same as for the <strong>PR_SET_MM_START_BRK</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following options are available since Linux 3.5.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_MM_ARG_START</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Set the address above which the program command line is placed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_MM_ARG_END</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Set the address below which the program command line is placed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_MM_ENV_START</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Set the address above which the program environment is placed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_MM_ENV_END</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Set the address below which the program environment is placed.</p>
<p>The address passed with <strong>PR_SET_MM_ARG_START</strong>, <strong>PR_SET_MM_ARG_END</strong>, <strong>PR_SET_MM_ENV_START</strong>, and <strong>PR_SET_MM_ENV_END</strong> should belong to a process stack area. Thus, the corresponding memory area must be readable, writable, and (depending on the kernel configuration) have the <strong>MAP_GROWSDOWN</strong> attribute set (see <strong>mmap</strong>(2)).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_MM_AUXV</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Set a new auxiliary vector. The <em>arg3</em> argument should provide the address of the vector. The <em>arg4</em> is the size of the vector.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_MM_EXE_FILE</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Supersede the <em>/proc/pid/exe</em> symbolic link with a new one pointing to a new executable file identified by the file descriptor provided in <em>arg3</em> argument. The file descriptor should be obtained with a regular <strong>open</strong>(2) call.</p>
<p>To change the symbolic link, one needs to unmap all existing executable memory areas, including those created by the kernel itself (for example the kernel usually creates at least one executable memory area for the ELF <em>.text</em> section).</p>
<p>In Linux 4.9 and earlier, the <strong>PR_SET_MM_EXE_FILE</strong> operation can be performed only once in a process's lifetime; attempting to perform the operation a second time results in the error <strong>EPERM</strong>. This restriction was enforced for security reasons that were subsequently deemed specious, and the restriction was removed in Linux 4.10 because some user-space applications needed to perform this operation more than once.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following options are available since Linux 3.18.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_MM_MAP</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Provides one-shot access to all the addresses by passing in a <em>struct prctl_mm_map</em> (as defined in <em>&lt;linux/prctl.h&gt;</em>). The <em>arg4</em> argument should provide the size of the struct.</p>
<p>This feature is available only if the kernel is built with the <strong>CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE</strong> option enabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_MM_MAP_SIZE</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the size of the <em>struct prctl_mm_map</em> the kernel expects. This allows user space to find a compatible struct. The <em>arg4</em> argument should be a pointer to an unsigned int.</p>
<p>This feature is available only if the kernel is built with the <strong>CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE</strong> option enabled.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_MPX_ENABLE_MANAGEMENT</strong>, <strong>PR_MPX_DISABLE_MANAGEMENT</strong> (since Linux 3.19, removed in Linux 5.4; only on x86)</dt>
<dd><p>Enable or disable kernel management of Memory Protection eXtensions (MPX) bounds tables. The <em>arg2</em>, <em>arg3</em>, <em>arg4</em>, and <em>arg5</em> arguments must be zero.</p>
<p>MPX is a hardware-assisted mechanism for performing bounds checking on pointers. It consists of a set of registers storing bounds information and a set of special instruction prefixes that tell the CPU on which instructions it should do bounds enforcement. There is a limited number of these registers and when there are more pointers than registers, their contents must be "spilled" into a set of tables. These tables are called "bounds tables" and the MPX <strong>prctl</strong>() operations control whether the kernel manages their allocation and freeing.</p>
<p>When management is enabled, the kernel will take over allocation and freeing of the bounds tables. It does this by trapping the #BR exceptions that result at first use of missing bounds tables and instead of delivering the exception to user space, it allocates the table and populates the bounds directory with the location of the new table. For freeing, the kernel checks to see if bounds tables are present for memory which is not allocated, and frees them if so.</p>
<p>Before enabling MPX management using <strong>PR_MPX_ENABLE_MANAGEMENT</strong>, the application must first have allocated a user-space buffer for the bounds directory and placed the location of that directory in the <em>bndcfgu</em> register.</p>
<p>These calls fail if the CPU or kernel does not support MPX. Kernel support for MPX is enabled via the <strong>CONFIG_X86_INTEL_MPX</strong> configuration option. You can check whether the CPU supports MPX by looking for the <em>mpx</em> CPUID bit, like with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep &#39; mpx &#39;</code></pre>
<p>A thread may not switch in or out of long (64-bit) mode while MPX is enabled.</p>
<p>All threads in a process are affected by these calls.</p>
<p>The child of a <strong>fork</strong>(2) inherits the state of MPX management. During <strong>execve</strong>(2), MPX management is reset to a state as if <strong>PR_MPX_DISABLE_MANAGEMENT</strong> had been called.</p>
<p>For further information on Intel MPX, see the kernel source file <em>Documentation/x86/intel_mpx.txt</em>.</p>
<p>Due to a lack of toolchain support, <strong>PR_MPX_ENABLE_MANAGEMENT</strong> and <strong>PR_MPX_DISABLE_MANAGEMENT</strong> are not supported in Linux 5.4 and later.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_NAME</strong> (since Linux 2.6.9)</dt>
<dd><p>Set the name of the calling thread, using the value in the location pointed to by <em>(char *) arg2</em>. The name can be up to 16 bytes long, including the terminating null byte. (If the length of the string, including the terminating null byte, exceeds 16 bytes, the string is silently truncated.) This is the same attribute that can be set via <strong>pthread_setname_np</strong>(3) and retrieved using <strong>pthread_getname_np</strong>(3). The attribute is likewise accessible via <em>/proc/self/task/[tid]/comm</em> (see <strong>proc</strong>(5)), where <em>[tid]</em> is the thread ID of the calling thread, as returned by <strong>gettid</strong>(2).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_GET_NAME</strong> (since Linux 2.6.11)</dt>
<dd><p>Return the name of the calling thread, in the buffer pointed to by <em>(char *) arg2</em>. The buffer should allow space for up to 16 bytes; the returned string will be null-terminated.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</strong> (since Linux 3.5)</dt>
<dd><p>Set the calling thread's <em>no_new_privs</em> attribute to the value in <em>arg2</em>. With <em>no_new_privs</em> set to 1, <strong>execve</strong>(2) promises not to grant privileges to do anything that could not have been done without the <strong>execve</strong>(2) call (for example, rendering the set-user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits, and file capabilities non-functional). Once set, the <em>no_new_privs</em> attribute cannot be unset. The setting of this attribute is inherited by children created by <strong>fork</strong>(2) and <strong>clone</strong>(2), and preserved across <strong>execve</strong>(2).</p>
<p>Since Linux 4.10, the value of a thread's <em>no_new_privs</em> attribute can be viewed via the <em>NoNewPrivs</em> field in the <em>/proc/[pid]/status</em> file.</p>
<p>For more information, see the kernel source file <em>Documentation/userspace-api/no_new_privs.rst</em> (or <em>Documentation/prctl/no_new_privs.txt</em> before Linux 4.13). See also <strong>seccomp</strong>(2).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PR_GET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</strong> (since Linux 3.5)</dt>

<p><em>Warning</em>: the "parent" in this case is considered to be the <em>thread</em> that created this process. In other words, the signal will be sent when that thread terminates (via, for example, <strong>pthread_exit</strong>(3)), rather than after all of the threads in the parent process terminate.</p>
<p>The parent-death signal is sent upon subsequent termination of the parent thread and also upon termination of each subreaper process (see the description of <strong>PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER</strong> above) to which the caller is subsequently reparented. If the parent thread and all ancestor subreapers have already terminated by the time of the <strong>PR_SET_PDEATHSIG</strong> operation, then no parent-death signal is sent to the caller.</p>
<p>The parent-death signal is process-directed (see <strong>signal</strong>(7)) and, if the child installs a handler using the <strong>sigaction</strong>(2) <strong>SA_SIGINFO</strong> flag, the <em>si_pid</em> field of the <em>siginfo_t</em> argument of the handler contains the PID of the terminating parent process.</p>
<p>The parent-death signal setting is cleared for the child of a <strong>fork</strong>(2).

Other system calls result in the delivery of a <strong>SIGKILL</strong> signal. Strict secure computing mode is useful for number-crunching applications that may need to execute untrusted byte code, perhaps obtained by reading from a pipe or socket. This operation is available only if the kernel is configured with <strong>CONFIG_SECCOMP</strong> enabled.</p>
<p>With <em>arg2</em> set to <strong>SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER</strong> (since Linux 3.5), the system calls allowed are defined by a pointer to a Berkeley Packet Filter passed in <em>arg3</em>.

This mode is available only if the kernel is configured with <strong>CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER</strong> enabled.</p>

<p>The bits of <em>arg2</em> corresponding to <strong>PR_SVE_VL_LEN_MASK</strong> must be set to the desired vector length in bytes. This is interpreted as an upper bound: the kernel will select the greatest available vector length that does not exceed the value specified. In particular, specifying <strong>SVE_VL_MAX</strong> (defined in <em>&lt;asm/sigcontext.h&gt;)</em> for the <strong>PR_SVE_VL_LEN_MASK</strong> bits requests the maximum supported vector length.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>0</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Perform the change immediately. At the next <strong>execve</strong>(2) in the thread, the vector length will be reset to the value configured in <em>/proc/sys/abi/sve_default_vector_length</em>.</p>

If the nanosecond value supplied in <em>arg2</em> is greater than zero, then the "current" value is set to this value. If <em>arg2</em> is equal to zero, the "current" timer slack is reset to the thread's "default" timer slack value.</p>

<h1>VERSIONS</h1>
<p>The <strong>prctl</strong>() system call was introduced in Linux 2.1.57.</p>
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>This call is Linux-specific. IRIX has a <strong>prctl</strong>() system call (also introduced in Linux 2.1.44 as irix_prctl on the MIPS architecture), with prototype</p>
<pre><code>ptrdiff_t prctl(int option, int arg2, int arg3);</code></pre>
<p>and options to get the maximum number of processes per user, get the maximum number of processors the calling process can use, find out whether a specified process is currently blocked, get or set the maximum stack size, and so on.</p>
