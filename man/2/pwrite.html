<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>pread, pwrite - read from or write to a file descriptor at a given offset</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>ssize_t pread(int </strong><em>fd</em><strong>, void *</strong><em>buf</em><strong>, size_t </strong><em>count</em><strong>",</strong><em>off_t</em><strong>"</strong><em>offset</em><strong>);</strong></p>
<p><strong>ssize_t pwrite(int </strong><em>fd</em><strong>, const void *</strong><em>buf</em><strong>, size_t </strong><em>count</em><strong>",</strong><em>off_t</em><strong>"</strong><em>offset</em><strong>);</strong></p>

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>pread</strong>() reads up to <em>count</em> bytes from file descriptor <em>fd</em> at offset <em>offset</em> (from the start of the file) into the buffer starting at <em>buf</em>. The file offset is not changed.</p>
<p><strong>pwrite</strong>() writes up to <em>count</em> bytes from the buffer starting at <em>buf</em> to the file descriptor <em>fd</em> at offset <em>offset</em>. The file offset is not changed.</p>
<p>The file referenced by <em>fd</em> must be capable of seeking.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>On success, <strong>pread</strong>() returns the number of bytes read (a return of zero indicates end of file) and <strong>pwrite</strong>() returns the number of bytes written.</p>
<p>Note that it is not an error for a successful call to transfer fewer bytes than requested (see <strong>read</strong>(2) and <strong>write</strong>(2)).</p>
<p>On error, -1 is returned and <em>errno</em> is set to indicate the cause of the error.</p>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>
<p><strong>pread</strong>() can fail and set <em>errno</em> to any error specified for <strong>read</strong>(2) or <strong>lseek</strong>(2). <strong>pwrite</strong>() can fail and set <em>errno</em> to any error specified for <strong>write</strong>(2) or <strong>lseek</strong>(2).</p>
<h1>VERSIONS</h1>
<p>The <strong>pread</strong>() and <strong>pwrite</strong>() system calls were added to Linux in version 2.1.60; the entries in the i386 system call table were added in 2.1.69. C library support (including emulation using <strong>lseek</strong>(2) on older kernels without the system calls) was added in glibc 2.1.</p>
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>The <strong>pread</strong>() and <strong>pwrite</strong>() system calls are especially useful in multithreaded applications. They allow multiple threads to perform I/O on the same file descriptor without being affected by changes to the file offset by other threads.</p>
<h2>C library/kernel differences</h2>
<p>On Linux, the underlying system calls were renamed in kernel 2.6: <strong>pread</strong>() became <strong>pread64</strong>(), and <strong>pwrite</strong>() became <strong>pwrite64</strong>(). The system call numbers remained the same. The glibc <strong>pread</strong>() and <strong>pwrite</strong>() wrapper functions transparently deal with the change.</p>
<p>On some 32-bit architectures, the calling signature for these system calls differ, for the reasons described in <strong>syscall</strong>(2).</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>POSIX requires that opening a file with the <strong>O_APPEND</strong> flag should have no effect on the location at which <strong>pwrite</strong>() writes data. However, on Linux, if a file is opened with <strong>O_APPEND</strong>, <strong>pwrite</strong>() appends data to the end of the file, regardless of the value of <em>offset</em>.</p>
