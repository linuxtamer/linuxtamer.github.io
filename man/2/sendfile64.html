<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sendfile - transfer data between file descriptors</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>#include &lt;sys/sendfile.h&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>ssize_t sendfile(int</strong><em> out_fd</em><strong>, int</strong><em> in_fd</em><strong>, off_t *</strong><em></em><strong>offset</strong><em>, size_t</em><strong> count</strong><em>);</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>sendfile</strong>() copies data between one file descriptor and another. Because this copying is done within the kernel, <strong>sendfile</strong>() is more efficient than the combination of <strong>read</strong>(2) and <strong>write</strong>(2), which would require transferring data to and from user space.</p>
<p><em>in_fd</em> should be a file descriptor opened for reading and <em>out_fd</em> should be a descriptor opened for writing.</p>
<p>If <em>offset</em> is not NULL, then it points to a variable holding the file offset from which <strong>sendfile</strong>() will start reading data from <em>in_fd</em>. When <strong>sendfile</strong>() returns, this variable will be set to the offset of the byte following the last byte that was read. If <em>offset</em> is not NULL, then <strong>sendfile</strong>() does not modify the file offset of <em>in_fd</em>; otherwise the file offset is adjusted to reflect the number of bytes read from <em>in_fd</em>.</p>
<p>If <em>offset</em> is NULL, then data will be read from <em>in_fd</em> starting at the file offset, and the file offset will be updated by the call.</p>
<p><em>count</em> is the number of bytes to copy between the file descriptors.</p>
<p>The <em>in_fd</em> argument must correspond to a file which supports <strong>mmap</strong>(2)-like operations (i.e., it cannot be a socket).</p>
<p>In Linux kernels before 2.6.33, <em>out_fd</em> must refer to a socket. Since Linux 2.6.33 it can be any file. If it is a regular file, then <strong>sendfile</strong>() changes the file offset appropriately.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>If the transfer was successful, the number of bytes written to <em>out_fd</em> is returned. Note that a successful call to <strong>sendfile</strong>() may write fewer bytes than requested; the caller should be prepared to retry the call if there were unsent bytes. See also NOTES.</p>
<p>On error, -1 is returned, and <em>errno</em> is set appropriately.</p>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>EAGAIN</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Nonblocking I/O has been selected using <strong>O_NONBLOCK</strong> and the write would block.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EBADF</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The input file was not opened for reading or the output file was not opened for writing.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EFAULT</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Bad address.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EINVAL</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Descriptor is not valid or locked, or an <strong>mmap</strong>(2)-like operation is not available for <em>in_fd</em>, or <em>count</em> is negative.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EINVAL</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>out_fd</em> has the <strong>O_APPEND</strong> flag set. This is not currently supported by <strong>sendfile</strong>().</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EIO</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Unspecified error while reading from <em>in_fd</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ENOMEM</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Insufficient memory to read from <em>in_fd</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EOVERFLOW</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>count</em> is too large, the operation would result in exceeding the maximum size of either the input file or the output file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ESPIPE</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>offset</em> is not NULL but the input file is not seekable.</p>
</dd>

<h1>VERSIONS</h1>
<p><strong>sendfile</strong>() first appeared in Linux 2.2. The include file <em>&lt;sys/sendfile.h&gt;</em> is present since glibc 2.1.</p>
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>Not specified in POSIX.1-2001, nor in other standards.</p>
<p>Other UNIX systems implement <strong>sendfile</strong>() with different semantics and prototypes. It should not be used in portable programs.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p><strong>sendfile</strong>() will transfer at most 0x7ffff000 (2,147,479,552) bytes, returning the number of bytes actually transferred. (This is true on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.)</p>
<p>If you plan to use <strong>sendfile</strong>() for sending files to a TCP socket, but need to send some header data in front of the file contents, you will find it useful to employ the <strong>TCP_CORK</strong> option, described in <strong>tcp</strong>(7), to minimize the number of packets and to tune performance.</p>
<p>In Linux 2.4 and earlier, <em>out_fd</em> could also refer to a regular file; this possibility went away in the Linux 2.6.x kernel series, but was restored in Linux 2.6.33.</p>
<p>The original Linux <strong>sendfile</strong>() system call was not designed to handle large file offsets. Consequently, Linux 2.4 added <strong>sendfile64</strong>(), with a wider type for the <em>offset</em> argument. The glibc <strong>sendfile</strong>() wrapper function transparently deals with the kernel differences.</p>
<p>Applications may wish to fall back to <strong>read</strong>(2)/<strong>write</strong>(2) in the case where <strong>sendfile</strong>() fails with <strong>EINVAL</strong> or <strong>ENOSYS</strong>.</p>
<p>If <em>out_fd</em> refers to a socket or pipe with zero-copy support, callers must ensure the transferred portions of the file referred to by <em>in_fd</em> remain unmodified until the reader on the other end of <em>out_fd</em> has consumed the transferred data.</p>
<p>The Linux-specific <strong>splice</strong>(2) call supports transferring data between arbitrary file descriptors provided one (or both) of them is a pipe.</p>
