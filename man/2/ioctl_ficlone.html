<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>ioctl_ficlonerange, ioctl_ficlone - share some the data of one file with another file</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>#include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</strong><br />
<strong>#include &lt;linux/fs.h&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>int ioctl(int </strong><em>dest_fd</em><strong>, FICLONERANGE, struct file_clone_range *</strong><em>arg</em><strong>);</strong><br />
<strong>int ioctl(int </strong><em>dest_fd</em><strong>, FICLONE, int </strong><em>src_fd</em><strong>);</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>If a filesystem supports files sharing physical storage between multiple files ("reflink"), this <strong>ioctl</strong>(2) operation can be used to make some of the data in the <em>src_fd</em> file appear in the <em>dest_fd</em> file by sharing the underlying storage, which is faster than making a separate physical copy of the data. Both files must reside within the same filesystem. If a file write should occur to a shared region, the filesystem must ensure that the changes remain private to the file being written. This behavior is commonly referred to as "copy on write".</p>
<p>This ioctl reflinks up to <em>src_length</em> bytes from file descriptor <em>src_fd</em> at offset <em>src_offset</em> into the file <em>dest_fd</em> at offset <em>dest_offset</em>, provided that both are files. If <em>src_length</em> is zero, the ioctl reflinks to the end of the source file. This information is conveyed in a structure of the following form:</p>
<pre><code>struct file_clone_range {
    __s64 src_fd;
    __u64 src_offset;
    __u64 src_length;
    __u64 dest_offset;
};</code></pre>
<p>Clones are atomic with regards to concurrent writes, so no locks need to be taken to obtain a consistent cloned copy.</p>
<p>The <strong>FICLONE</strong> ioctl clones entire files.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>On error, -1 is returned, and <em>errno</em> is set to indicate the error.</p>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>
<p>Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>EBADF</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>src_fd</em> is not open for reading; <em>dest_fd</em> is not open for writing or is open for append-only writes; or the filesystem which <em>src_fd</em> resides on does not support reflink.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EINVAL</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The filesystem does not support reflinking the ranges of the given files. This error can also appear if either file descriptor represents a device, FIFO, or socket. Disk filesystems generally require the offset and length arguments to be aligned to the fundamental block size. XFS and Btrfs do not support overlapping reflink ranges in the same file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EISDIR</strong></dt>
<dd><p>One of the files is a directory and the filesystem does not support shared regions in directories.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EOPNOTSUPP</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This can appear if the filesystem does not support reflinking either file descriptor, or if either file descriptor refers to special inodes.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EPERM</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>dest_fd</em> is immutable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ETXTBSY</strong></dt>
<dd><p>One of the files is a swap file. Swap files cannot share storage.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EXDEV</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>dest_fd</em> and <em>src_fd</em> are not on the same mounted filesystem.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>VERSIONS</h1>
<p>These ioctl operations first appeared in Linux 4.5. They were previously known as <strong>BTRFS_IOC_CLONE</strong> and <strong>BTRFS_IOC_CLONE_RANGE</strong>, and were private to Btrfs.</p>
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>This API is Linux-specific.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Because a copy-on-write operation requires the allocation of new storage, the <strong>fallocate</strong>(2) operation may unshare shared blocks to guarantee that subsequent writes will not fail because of lack of disk space.</p>
