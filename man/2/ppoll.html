<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>poll, ppoll - wait for some event on a file descriptor</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;poll.h&gt;

int poll(struct pollfd *fds, nfds_t nfds, int timeout);

#define _GNU_SOURCE /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
#include &lt;signal.h&gt;
#include &lt;poll.h&gt;

int ppoll(struct pollfd *fds, nfds_t nfds,
 const struct timespec *tmo_p, const sigset_t *sigmask);</code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>poll</strong>() performs a similar task to <strong>select</strong>(2): it waits for one of a set of file descriptors to become ready to perform I/O. The Linux-specific <strong>epoll</strong>(7) API performs a similar task, but offers features beyond those found in <strong>poll</strong>().</p>
<p>The set of file descriptors to be monitored is specified in the <em>fds</em> argument, which is an array of structures of the following form:</p>
<pre><code>struct pollfd {
    int   fd;         /* file descriptor */
    short events;     /* requested events */
    short revents;    /* returned events */
};</code></pre>
<p>The caller should specify the number of items in the <em>fds</em> array in <em>nfds</em>.</p>
<p>The field <em>fd</em> contains a file descriptor for an open file. If this field is negative, then the corresponding <em>events</em> field is ignored and the <em>revents</em> field returns zero. (This provides an easy way of ignoring a file descriptor for a single <strong>poll</strong>() call: simply negate the <em>fd</em> field. Note, however, that this technique can't be used to ignore file descriptor 0.)</p>
<p>The field <em>events</em> is an input parameter, a bit mask specifying the events the application is interested in for the file descriptor <em>fd</em>. This field may be specified as zero, in which case the only events that can be returned in <em>revents</em> are <strong>POLLHUP</strong>, <strong>POLLERR</strong>, and <strong>POLLNVAL</strong> (see below).</p>
<p>The field <em>revents</em> is an output parameter, filled by the kernel with the events that actually occurred. The bits returned in <em>revents</em> can include any of those specified in <em>events</em>, or one of the values <strong>POLLERR</strong>, <strong>POLLHUP</strong>, or <strong>POLLNVAL</strong>. (These three bits are meaningless in the <em>events</em> field, and will be set in the <em>revents</em> field whenever the corresponding condition is true.)</p>
<p>If none of the events requested (and no error) has occurred for any of the file descriptors, then <strong>poll</strong>() blocks until one of the events occurs.</p>
<p>The <em>timeout</em> argument specifies the number of milliseconds that <strong>poll</strong>() should block waiting for a file descriptor to become ready. The call will block until either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a file descriptor becomes ready;</p></li>
<li><p>the call is interrupted by a signal handler; or</p></li>
<li><p>the timeout expires.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the <em>timeout</em> interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity, and kernel scheduling delays mean that the blocking interval may overrun by a small amount. Specifying a negative value in <em>timeout</em> means an infinite timeout. Specifying a <em>timeout</em> of zero causes <strong>poll</strong>() to return immediately, even if no file descriptors are ready.</p>
<p>The bits that may be set/returned in <em>events</em> and <em>revents</em> are defined in <em>&lt;poll.h&gt;</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>POLLIN</strong></dt>
<dd><p>There is data to read.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POLLPRI</strong></dt>
<dd><p>There is some exceptional condition on the file descriptor. Possibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is out-of-band data on a TCP socket (see <strong>tcp</strong>(7)).</p></li>
<li><p>A pseudoterminal master in packet mode has seen a state change on the slave (see <strong>ioctl_tty</strong>(2)).</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>cgroup.events</em> file has been modified (see <strong>cgroups</strong>(7)).</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POLLOUT</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Writing is now possible, though a write larger than the available space in a socket or pipe will still block (unless <strong>O_NONBLOCK</strong> is set).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POLLRDHUP</strong> (since Linux 2.6.17)</dt>
<dd><p>Stream socket peer closed connection, or shut down writing half of connection. The <strong>_GNU_SOURCE</strong> feature test macro must be defined (before including <em>any</em> header files) in order to obtain this definition.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POLLERR</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Error condition (only returned in <em>revents</em>; ignored in <em>events</em>). This bit is also set for a file descriptor referring to the write end of a pipe when the read end has been closed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POLLHUP</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Hang up (only returned in <em>revents</em>; ignored in <em>events</em>). Note that when reading from a channel such as a pipe or a stream socket, this event merely indicates that the peer closed its end of the channel. Subsequent reads from the channel will return 0 (end of file) only after all outstanding data in the channel has been consumed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POLLNVAL</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Invalid request: <em>fd</em> not open (only returned in <em>revents</em>; ignored in <em>events</em>).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When compiling with <strong>_XOPEN_SOURCE</strong> defined, one also has the following, which convey no further information beyond the bits listed above:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>POLLRDNORM</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Equivalent to <strong>POLLIN</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POLLRDBAND</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Priority band data can be read (generally unused on Linux).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POLLWRNORM</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Equivalent to <strong>POLLOUT</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POLLWRBAND</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Priority data may be written.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Linux also knows about, but does not use <strong>POLLMSG</strong>.</p>
<h2>ppoll()</h2>
<p>The relationship between <strong>poll</strong>() and <strong>ppoll</strong>() is analogous to the relationship between <strong>select</strong>(2) and <strong>pselect</strong>(2): like <strong>pselect</strong>(2), <strong>ppoll</strong>() allows an application to safely wait until either a file descriptor becomes ready or until a signal is caught.</p>
<p>Other than the difference in the precision of the <em>timeout</em> argument, the following <strong>ppoll</strong>() call:</p>
<pre><code>ready = ppoll(&amp;fds, nfds, tmo_p, &amp;sigmask);</code></pre>
<p>is nearly equivalent to <em>atomically</em> executing the following calls:</p>
<pre><code>sigset_t origmask;
int timeout;

timeout = (tmo_p == NULL) ? -1 :
          (tmo_p-&gt;tv_sec * 1000 + tmo_p-&gt;tv_nsec / 1000000);
pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;sigmask, &amp;origmask);
ready = poll(&amp;fds, nfds, timeout);
pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;origmask, NULL);</code></pre>
<p>The above code segment is described as <em>nearly</em> equivalent because whereas a negative <em>timeout</em> value for <strong>poll</strong>() is interpreted as an infinite timeout, a negative value expressed in <em>*tmo_p</em> results in an error from <strong>ppoll</strong>().</p>
<p>See the description of <strong>pselect</strong>(2) for an explanation of why <strong>ppoll</strong>() is necessary.</p>
<p>If the <em>sigmask</em> argument is specified as NULL, then no signal mask manipulation is performed (and thus <strong>ppoll</strong>() differs from <strong>poll</strong>() only in the precision of the <em>timeout</em> argument).</p>
<p>The <em>tmo_p</em> argument specifies an upper limit on the amount of time that <strong>ppoll</strong>() will block. This argument is a pointer to a structure of the following form:</p>
<pre><code>struct timespec {
    long    tv_sec;         /* seconds */
    long    tv_nsec;        /* nanoseconds */
};</code></pre>
<p>If <em>tmo_p</em> is specified as NULL, then <strong>ppoll</strong>() can block indefinitely.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>On success, <strong>poll</strong>() returns a nonnegative value which is the number of elements in the <em>pollfds</em> whose <em>revents</em> fields have been set to a nonzero value (indicating an event or an error). A return value of zero indicates that the system call timed out before any file descriptors became read.</p>
<p>On error, -1 is returned, and <em>errno</em> is set to indicate the cause of the error.</p>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>EFAULT</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>fds</em> points outside the process's accessible address space. The array given as argument was not contained in the calling program's address space.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EINTR</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A signal occurred before any requested event; see <strong>signal</strong>(7).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EINVAL</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The <em>nfds</em> value exceeds the <strong>RLIMIT_NOFILE</strong> value.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EINVAL</strong></dt>
<dd><p>(<strong>ppoll</strong>()) The timeout value expressed in <em>*ip</em> is invalid (negative).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ENOMEM</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Unable to allocate memory for kernel data structures.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>VERSIONS</h1>
<p>The <strong>poll</strong>() system call was introduced in Linux 2.1.23. On older kernels that lack this system call, the glibc <strong>poll</strong>() wrapper function provides emulation using <strong>select</strong>(2).</p>
<p>The <strong>ppoll</strong>() system call was added to Linux in kernel 2.6.16. The <strong>ppoll</strong>() library call was added in glibc 2.4.</p>
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p><strong>poll</strong>() conforms to POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008. <strong>ppoll</strong>() is Linux-specific.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>The operation of <strong>poll</strong>() and <strong>ppoll</strong>() is not affected by the <strong>O_NONBLOCK</strong> flag.</p>
<p>On some other UNIX systems, <strong>poll</strong>() can fail with the error <strong>EAGAIN</strong> if the system fails to allocate kernel-internal resources, rather than <strong>ENOMEM</strong> as Linux does. POSIX permits this behavior. Portable programs may wish to check for <strong>EAGAIN</strong> and loop, just as with <strong>EINTR</strong>.</p>
<p>Some implementations define the nonstandard constant <strong>INFTIM</strong> with the value -1 for use as a <em>timeout</em> for <strong>poll</strong>(). This constant is not provided in glibc.</p>
<p>For a discussion of what may happen if a file descriptor being monitored by <strong>poll</strong>() is closed in another thread, see <strong>select</strong>(2).</p>
<h2>C library/kernel differences</h2>
<p>The Linux <strong>ppoll</strong>() system call modifies its <em>tmo_p</em> argument. However, the glibc wrapper function hides this behavior by using a local variable for the timeout argument that is passed to the system call. Thus, the glibc <strong>ppoll</strong>() function does not modify its <em>tmo_p</em> argument.</p>
<p>The raw <strong>ppoll</strong>() system call has a fifth argument, <em>size_t sigsetsize</em>, which specifies the size in bytes of the <em>sigmask</em> argument. The glibc <strong>ppoll</strong>() wrapper function specifies this argument as a fixed value (equal to <em>sizeof(kernel_sigset_t)</em>). See <strong>sigprocmask</strong>(2) for a discussion on the differences between the kernel and the libc notion of the sigset.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>See the discussion of spurious readiness notifications under the BUGS section of <strong>select</strong>(2).</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>The program below opens each of the files named in its command-line arguments and monitors the resulting file descriptors for readiness to read (<strong>POLLIN</strong>). The program loops, repeatedly using <strong>poll</strong>() to monitor the file descriptors, printing the number of ready file descriptors on return. For each ready file descriptor, the program:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>displays the returned <em>revents</em> field in a human-readable form;</p></li>
<li><p>if the file descriptor is readable, reads some data from it, and displays that data on standard output; and</p></li>
<li><p>if the file descriptors was not readable, but some other event occurred (presumably <strong>POLLHUP</strong>), closes the file descriptor.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose we run the program in one terminal, asking it to open a FIFO:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkfifo myfifo
$ ./poll_input myfifo</code></pre>
<p>In a second terminal window, we then open the FIFO for writing, write some data to it, and close the FIFO:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo aaaaabbbbbccccc &gt; myfifo</code></pre>
<p>In the terminal where we are running the program, we would then see:</p>
<pre><code>Opened &quot;myfifo&quot; on fd 3
About to poll()
Ready: 1
  fd=3; events: POLLIN POLLHUP
    read 10 bytes: aaaaabbbbb
About to poll()
Ready: 1
  fd=3; events: POLLIN POLLHUP
    read 6 bytes: ccccc

About to poll()
Ready: 1
  fd=3; events: POLLHUP
    closing fd 3
All file descriptors closed; bye</code></pre>
<p>In the above output, we see that <strong>poll</strong>() returned three times:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On the first return, the bits returned in the <em>revents</em> field were <strong>POLLIN</strong>, indicating that the file descriptor is readable, and <strong>POLLHUP</strong>, indicating that the other end of the FIFO has been closed. The program then consumed some of the available input.</p></li>
<li><p>The second return from <strong>poll</strong>() also indicated <strong>POLLIN</strong> and <strong>POLLHUP</strong>; the program then consumed the last of the available input.</p></li>
<li><p>On the final return, <strong>poll</strong>() indicated only <strong>POLLHUP</strong> on the FIFO, at which point the file descriptor was closed and the program terminated.</p></li>
</ul>
