<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>ioprio_get, ioprio_set - get/set I/O scheduling class and priority</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>int ioprio_get(int which, int who);
int ioprio_set(int which, int who, int ioprio);</code></pre>
<p><em>Note</em>: There are no glibc wrappers for these system calls; see NOTES.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>ioprio_get</strong>() and <strong>ioprio_set</strong>() system calls get and set the I/O scheduling class and priority of one or more threads.</p>
<p>The <em>which</em> and <em>who</em> arguments identify the thread(s) on which the system calls operate. The <em>which</em> argument determines how <em>who</em> is interpreted, and has one of the following values:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>IOPRIO_WHO_PROCESS</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>who</em> is a process ID or thread ID identifying a single process or thread. If <em>who</em> is 0, then operate on the calling thread.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>who</em> is a process group ID identifying all the members of a process group. If <em>who</em> is 0, then operate on the process group of which the caller is a member.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>IOPRIO_WHO_USER</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>who</em> is a user ID identifying all of the processes that have a matching real UID.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If <em>which</em> is specified as <strong>IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP</strong> or <strong>IOPRIO_WHO_USER</strong> when calling <strong>ioprio_get</strong>(), and more than one process matches <em>who</em>, then the returned priority will be the highest one found among all of the matching processes. One priority is said to be higher than another one if it belongs to a higher priority class (<strong>IOPRIO_CLASS_RT</strong> is the highest priority class; <strong>IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE</strong> is the lowest) or if it belongs to the same priority class as the other process but has a higher priority level (a lower priority number means a higher priority level).</p>
<p>The <em>ioprio</em> argument given to <strong>ioprio_set</strong>() is a bit mask that specifies both the scheduling class and the priority to be assigned to the target process(es). The following macros are used for assembling and dissecting <em>ioprio</em> values:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>IOPRIO_PRIO_VALUE(</strong><em>class</em><strong>, </strong><em>data</em><strong>)</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Given a scheduling <em>class</em> and priority (<em>data</em>), this macro combines the two values to produce an <em>ioprio</em> value, which is returned as the result of the macro.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>IOPRIO_PRIO_CLASS(</strong><em>mask</em><strong>)</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Given <em>mask</em> (an <em>ioprio</em> value), this macro returns its I/O class component, that is, one of the values <strong>IOPRIO_CLASS_RT</strong>, <strong>IOPRIO_CLASS_BE</strong>, or <strong>IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>IOPRIO_PRIO_DATA(</strong><em>mask</em><strong>)</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Given <em>mask</em> (an <em>ioprio</em> value), this macro returns its priority (<em>data</em>) component.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>See the NOTES section for more information on scheduling classes and priorities, as well as the meaning of specifying <em>ioprio</em> as 0.</p>
<p>I/O priorities are supported for reads and for synchronous (<strong>O_DIRECT</strong>, <strong>O_SYNC</strong>) writes. I/O priorities are not supported for asynchronous writes because they are issued outside the context of the program dirtying the memory, and thus program-specific priorities do not apply.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>On success, <strong>ioprio_get</strong>() returns the <em>ioprio</em> value of the process with highest I/O priority of any of the processes that match the criteria specified in <em>which</em> and <em>who</em>. On error, -1 is returned, and <em>errno</em> is set to indicate the error.</p>
<p>On success, <strong>ioprio_set</strong>() returns 0. On error, -1 is returned, and <em>errno</em> is set to indicate the error.</p>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>EINVAL</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Invalid value for <em>which</em> or <em>ioprio</em>. Refer to the NOTES section for available scheduler classes and priority levels for <em>ioprio</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EPERM</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The calling process does not have the privilege needed to assign this <em>ioprio</em> to the specified process(es). See the NOTES section for more information on required privileges for <strong>ioprio_set</strong>().</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ESRCH</strong></dt>
<dd><p>No process(es) could be found that matched the specification in <em>which</em> and <em>who</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>VERSIONS</h1>
<p>These system calls have been available on Linux since kernel 2.6.13.</p>
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>These system calls are Linux-specific.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Glibc does not provide a wrapper for these system calls; call them using <strong>syscall</strong>(2).</p>
<p>Two or more processes or threads can share an I/O context. This will be the case when <strong>clone</strong>(2) was called with the <strong>CLONE_IO</strong> flag. However, by default, the distinct threads of a process will <strong>not</strong> share the same I/O context. This means that if you want to change the I/O priority of all threads in a process, you may need to call <strong>ioprio_set</strong>() on each of the threads. The thread ID that you would need for this operation is the one that is returned by <strong>gettid</strong>(2) or <strong>clone</strong>(2).</p>
<p>These system calls have an effect only when used in conjunction with an I/O scheduler that supports I/O priorities. As at kernel 2.6.17 the only such scheduler is the Completely Fair Queuing (CFQ) I/O scheduler.</p>
<p>If no I/O scheduler has been set for a thread, then by default the I/O priority will follow the CPU nice value (<strong>setpriority</strong>(2)). In Linux kernels before version 2.6.24, once an I/O priority had been set using <strong>ioprio_set</strong>(), there was no way to reset the I/O scheduling behavior to the default. Since Linux 2.6.24, specifying <em>ioprio</em> as 0 can be used to reset to the default I/O scheduling behavior.</p>
<h2>Selecting an I/O scheduler</h2>
<p>I/O schedulers are selected on a per-device basis via the special file <em>/sys/block/&lt;device&gt;/queue/scheduler</em>.</p>
<p>One can view the current I/O scheduler via the <em>/sys</em> filesystem. For example, the following command displays a list of all schedulers currently loaded in the kernel:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
noop anticipatory deadline [cfq]</code></pre>
<p>The scheduler surrounded by brackets is the one actually in use for the device (<em>sda</em> in the example). Setting another scheduler is done by writing the name of the new scheduler to this file. For example, the following command will set the scheduler for the <em>sda</em> device to <em>cfq</em>:</p>
<pre><code>$ su
Password:
# echo cfq &gt; /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler</code></pre>
<h2>The Completely Fair Queuing (CFQ) I/O scheduler</h2>
<p>Since version 3 (also known as CFQ Time Sliced), CFQ implements I/O nice levels similar to those of CPU scheduling. These nice levels are grouped into three scheduling classes, each one containing one or more priority levels:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>IOPRIO_CLASS_RT</strong> (1)</dt>
<dd><p>This is the real-time I/O class. This scheduling class is given higher priority than any other class: processes from this class are given first access to the disk every time. Thus, this I/O class needs to be used with some care: one I/O real-time process can starve the entire system. Within the real-time class, there are 8 levels of class data (priority) that determine exactly how much time this process needs the disk for on each service. The highest real-time priority level is 0; the lowest is 7. In the future, this might change to be more directly mappable to performance, by passing in a desired data rate instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>IOPRIO_CLASS_BE</strong> (2)</dt>
<dd><p>This is the best-effort scheduling class, which is the default for any process that hasn't set a specific I/O priority. The class data (priority) determines how much I/O bandwidth the process will get. Best-effort priority levels are analogous to CPU nice values (see <strong>getpriority</strong>(2)). The priority level determines a priority relative to other processes in the best-effort scheduling class. Priority levels range from 0 (highest) to 7 (lowest).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE</strong> (3)</dt>
<dd><p>This is the idle scheduling class. Processes running at this level get I/O time only when no one else needs the disk. The idle class has no class data. Attention is required when assigning this priority class to a process, since it may become starved if higher priority processes are constantly accessing the disk.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Refer to the kernel source file <em>Documentation/block/ioprio.txt</em> for more information on the CFQ I/O Scheduler and an example program.</p>
<h2>Required permissions to set I/O priorities</h2>
<p>Permission to change a process's priority is granted or denied based on two criteria:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Process ownership</strong></dt>
<dd><p>An unprivileged process may set the I/O priority only for a process whose real UID matches the real or effective UID of the calling process. A process which has the <strong>CAP_SYS_NICE</strong> capability can change the priority of any process.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>What is the desired priority</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Attempts to set very high priorities (<strong>IOPRIO_CLASS_RT</strong>) require the <strong>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</strong> capability. Kernel versions up to 2.6.24 also required <strong>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</strong> to set a very low priority (<strong>IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE</strong>), but since Linux 2.6.25, this is no longer required.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A call to <strong>ioprio_set</strong>() must follow both rules, or the call will fail with the error <strong>EPERM</strong>.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Glibc does not yet provide a suitable header file defining the function prototypes and macros described on this page. Suitable definitions can be found in <em>linux/ioprio.h</em>.</p>
