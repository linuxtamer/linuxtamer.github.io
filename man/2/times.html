<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>times - get process times</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>#include &lt;sys/times.h&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>clock_t times(struct tms *</strong><em>buf</em><strong>);</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>times</strong>() stores the current process times in the <em>struct tms</em> that <em>buf</em> points to. The <em>struct tms</em> is as defined in <em>&lt;sys/times.h&gt;</em>:</p>
<pre><code>struct tms {
    clock_t tms_utime;  /* user time */
    clock_t tms_stime;  /* system time */
    clock_t tms_cutime; /* user time of children */
    clock_t tms_cstime; /* system time of children */
};</code></pre>
<p>The <em>tms_utime</em> field contains the CPU time spent executing instructions of the calling process. The <em>tms_stime</em> field contains the CPU time spent executing inside the kernel while performing tasks on behalf of the calling process.</p>
<p>The <em>tms_cutime</em> field contains the sum of the <em>tms_utime</em> and <em>tms_cutime</em> values for all waited-for terminated children. The <em>tms_cstime</em> field contains the sum of the <em>tms_stime</em> and <em>tms_cstime</em> values for all waited-for terminated children.</p>
<p>Times for terminated children (and their descendants) are added in at the moment <strong>wait</strong>(2) or <strong>waitpid</strong>(2) returns their process ID. In particular, times of grandchildren that the children did not wait for are never seen.</p>
<p>All times reported are in clock ticks.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p><strong>times</strong>() returns the number of clock ticks that have elapsed since an arbitrary point in the past. The return value may overflow the possible range of type <em>clock_t</em>. On error, <em>(clock_t) -1</em> is returned, and <em>errno</em> is set appropriately.</p>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>EFAULT</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>tms</em> points outside the process's address space.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.3BSD.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>The number of clock ticks per second can be obtained using:</p>
<pre><code>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK);</code></pre>
<p>In POSIX.1-1996 the symbol <strong>CLK_TCK</strong> (defined in <em>&lt;time.h&gt;</em>) is mentioned as obsolescent. It is obsolete now.</p>
<p>In Linux kernel versions before 2.6.9, if the disposition of <strong>SIGCHLD</strong> is set to <strong>SIG_IGN</strong>, then the times of terminated children are automatically included in the <em>tms_cstime</em> and <em>tms_cutime</em> fields, although POSIX.1-2001 says that this should happen only if the calling process <strong>wait</strong>(2)s on its children. This nonconformance is rectified in Linux 2.6.9 and later.</p>
<p>On Linux, the <em>buf</em> argument can be specified as NULL, with the result that <strong>times</strong>() just returns a function result. However, POSIX does not specify this behavior, and most other UNIX implementations require a non-NULL value for <em>buf</em>.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>clock</strong>(3) also returns a value of type <em>clock_t</em>, but this value is measured in units of <strong>CLOCKS_PER_SEC</strong>, not the clock ticks used by <strong>times</strong>().</p>
<p>On Linux, the "arbitrary point in the past" from which the return value of <strong>times</strong>() is measured has varied across kernel versions. On Linux 2.4 and earlier, this point is the moment the system was booted. Since Linux 2.6, this point is <em>(2^32/HZ) - 300</em> seconds before system boot time. This variability across kernel versions (and across UNIX implementations), combined with the fact that the returned value may overflow the range of <em>clock_t</em>, means that a portable application would be wise to avoid using this value. To measure changes in elapsed time, use <strong>clock_gettime</strong>(2) instead.</p>
<h2>Historical</h2>
<p>SVr1-3 returns <em>long</em> and the struct members are of type <em>time_t</em> although they store clock ticks, not seconds since the Epoch. V7 used <em>long</em> for the struct members, because it had no type <em>time_t</em> yet.</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>A limitation of the Linux system call conventions on some architectures (notably i386) means that on Linux 2.6 there is a small time window (41 seconds) soon after boot when <strong>times</strong>() can return -1, falsely indicating that an error occurred. The same problem can occur when the return value wraps past the maximum value that can be stored in <strong>clock_t</strong>.</p>
