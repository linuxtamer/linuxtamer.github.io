<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>msync - synchronize a file with a memory map</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>int msync(void *</strong><em>addr</em><strong>, size_t </strong><em>length</em><strong>, int </strong><em>flags</em><strong>);</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>msync</strong>() flushes changes made to the in-core copy of a file that was mapped into memory using <strong>mmap</strong>(2) back to the filesystem. Without use of this call, there is no guarantee that changes are written back before <strong>munmap</strong>(2) is called. To be more precise, the part of the file that corresponds to the memory area starting at <em>addr</em> and having length <em>length</em> is updated.</p>
<p>The <em>flags</em> argument should specify exactly one of <strong>MS_ASYNC</strong> and <strong>MS_SYNC</strong>, and may additionally include the <strong>MS_INVALIDATE</strong> bit. These bits have the following meanings:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>MS_ASYNC</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies that an update be scheduled, but the call returns immediately.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MS_SYNC</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Requests an update and waits for it to complete.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MS_INVALIDATE</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Asks to invalidate other mappings of the same file (so that they can be updated with the fresh values just written).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned, and <em>errno</em> is set appropriately.</p>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>EBUSY</strong></dt>
<dd><p><strong>MS_INVALIDATE</strong> was specified in <em>flags</em>, and a memory lock exists for the specified address range.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EINVAL</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>addr</em> is not a multiple of PAGESIZE; or any bit other than <strong>MS_ASYNC</strong> | <strong>MS_INVALIDATE</strong> | <strong>MS_SYNC</strong> is set in <em>flags</em>; or both <strong>MS_SYNC</strong> and <strong>MS_ASYNC</strong> are set in <em>flags</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ENOMEM</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The indicated memory (or part of it) was not mapped.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.</p>
<p>This call was introduced in Linux 1.3.21, and then used <strong>EFAULT</strong> instead of <strong>ENOMEM</strong>. In Linux 2.4.19, this was changed to the POSIX value <strong>ENOMEM</strong>.</p>
<p>On POSIX systems on which <strong>msync</strong>() is available, both <strong>_POSIX_MAPPED_FILES</strong> and <strong>_POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO</strong> are defined in <em>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</em> to a value greater than 0. (See also <strong>sysconf</strong>(3).)</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>According to POSIX, either <strong>MS_SYNC</strong> or <strong>MS_ASYNC</strong> must be specified in <em>flags</em>, and indeed failure to include one of these flags will cause <strong>msync</strong>() to fail on some systems. However, Linux permits a call to <strong>msync</strong>() that specifies neither of these flags, with semantics that are (currently) equivalent to specifying <strong>MS_ASYNC</strong>. (Since Linux 2.6.19, <strong>MS_ASYNC</strong> is in fact a no-op, since the kernel properly tracks dirty pages and flushes them to storage as necessary.) Notwithstanding the Linux behavior, portable, future-proof applications should ensure that they specify either <strong>MS_SYNC</strong> or <strong>MS_ASYNC</strong> in <em>flags</em>.</p>
