<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>spu_create - create a new spu context</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/spu.h&gt;

int spu_create(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode,
 int neighbor_fd);</code></pre>
<p><em>Note</em>: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>spu_create</strong>() system call is used on PowerPC machines that implement the Cell Broadband Engine Architecture in order to access Synergistic Processor Units (SPUs). It creates a new logical context for an SPU in <em>pathname</em> and returns a file descriptor associated with it. <em>pathname</em> must refer to a nonexistent directory in the mount point of the SPU filesystem (<strong>spufs</strong>). If <strong>spu_create</strong>() is successful, a directory is created at <em>pathname</em> and it is populated with the files described in <strong>spufs</strong>(7).</p>
<p>When a context is created, the returned file descriptor can only be passed to <strong>spu_run</strong>(2), used as the <em>dirfd</em> argument to the <strong>*at</strong> family of system calls (e.g., <strong>openat</strong>(2)), or closed; other operations are not defined. A logical SPU context is destroyed (along with all files created within the context's <em>pathname</em> directory) once the last reference to the context has gone; this usually occurs when the file descriptor returned by <strong>spu_create</strong>() is closed.</p>
<p>The <em>mode</em> argument (minus any bits set in the process's <strong>umask</strong>(2)) specifies the permissions used for creating the new directory in <strong>spufs</strong>. See <strong>stat</strong>(2) for a full list of the possible <em>mode</em> values.</p>
<p>The <em>neighbor_fd</em> is used only when the <strong>SPU_CREATE_AFFINITY_SPU</strong> flag is specified; see below.</p>
<p>The <em>flags</em> argument can be zero or any bitwise OR-ed combination of the following constants:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SPU_CREATE_EVENTS_ENABLED</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Rather than using signals for reporting DMA errors, use the <em>event</em> argument to <strong>spu_run</strong>(2).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SPU_CREATE_GANG</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Create an SPU gang instead of a context. (A gang is a group of SPU contexts that are functionally related to each other and which share common scheduling parametersâ€”priority and policy. In the future, gang scheduling may be implemented causing the group to be switched in and out as a single unit.)</p>
<p>A new directory will be created at the location specified by the <em>pathname</em> argument. This gang may be used to hold other SPU contexts, by providing a pathname that is within the gang directory to further calls to <strong>spu_create</strong>().</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SPU_CREATE_NOSCHED</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Create a context that is not affected by the SPU scheduler. Once the context is run, it will not be scheduled out until it is destroyed by the creating process.</p>
<p>Because the context cannot be removed from the SPU, some functionality is disabled for <strong>SPU_CREATE_NOSCHED</strong> contexts. Only a subset of the files will be available in this context directory in <strong>spufs</strong>. Additionally, <strong>SPU_CREATE_NOSCHED</strong> contexts cannot dump a core file when crashing.</p>
<p>Creating <strong>SPU_CREATE_NOSCHED</strong> contexts requires the <strong>CAP_SYS_NICE</strong> capability.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SPU_CREATE_ISOLATE</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Create an isolated SPU context. Isolated contexts are protected from some PPE (PowerPC Processing Element) operations, such as access to the SPU local store and the NPC register.</p>
<p>Creating <strong>SPU_CREATE_ISOLATE</strong> contexts also requires the <strong>SPU_CREATE_NOSCHED</strong> flag.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SPU_CREATE_AFFINITY_SPU</strong> (since Linux 2.6.23)</dt>
<dd><p>Create a context with affinity to another SPU context. This affinity information is used within the SPU scheduling algorithm. Using this flag requires that a file descriptor referring to the other SPU context be passed in the <em>neighbor_fd</em> argument.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SPU_CREATE_AFFINITY_MEM</strong> (since Linux 2.6.23)</dt>
<dd><p>Create a context with affinity to system memory. This affinity information is used within the SPU scheduling algorithm.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>On success, <strong>spu_create</strong>() returns a new file descriptor. On error, -1 is returned, and <em>errno</em> is set to one of the error codes listed below.</p>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>EACCES</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The current user does not have write access to the <strong>spufs</strong>(7) mount point.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EEXIST</strong></dt>
<dd><p>An SPU context already exists at the given pathname.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EFAULT</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>pathname</em> is not a valid string pointer in the calling process's address space.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EINVAL</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>pathname</em> is not a directory in the <strong>spufs</strong>(7) mount point, or invalid flags have been provided.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ELOOP</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Too many symbolic links were found while resolving <em>pathname</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EMFILE</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ENAMETOOLONG</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>pathname</em> is too long.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ENFILE</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ENODEV</strong></dt>
<dd><p>An isolated context was requested, but the hardware does not support SPU isolation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ENOENT</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Part of <em>pathname</em> could not be resolved.</p>

<dt><strong>ENOMEM</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The kernel could not allocate all resources required.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ENOSPC</strong></dt>
<dd><p>There are not enough SPU resources available to create a new context or the user-specific limit for the number of SPU contexts has been reached.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ENOSYS</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The functionality is not provided by the current system, because either the hardware does not provide SPUs or the spufs module is not loaded.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ENOTDIR</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A part of <em>pathname</em> is not a directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EPERM</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The <strong>SPU_CREATE_NOSCHED</strong> flag has been given, but the user does not have the <strong>CAP_SYS_NICE</strong> capability.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<p><em>pathname</em> must point to a location beneath the mount point of <strong>spufs</strong>. By convention, it gets mounted in <em>/spu</em>.</p>
<h1>VERSIONS</h1>
<p>The <strong>spu_create</strong>() system call was added to Linux in kernel 2.6.16.</p>
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>This call is Linux-specific and implemented only on the PowerPC architecture. Programs using this system call are not portable.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call; call it using <strong>syscall</strong>(2). Note however, that <strong>spu_create</strong>() is meant to be used from libraries that implement a more abstract interface to SPUs, not to be used from regular applications. See <a href="http://www.bsc.es/projects/deepcomputing/linuxoncell/"></a> for the recommended libraries.</p>
<p>Prior to the addition of the <strong>SPU_CREATE_AFFINITY_SPU</strong> flag in Linux 2.6.23, the <strong>spu_create</strong>() system call took only three arguments (i.e., there was no <em>neighbor_fd</em> argument).</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>See <strong>spu_run</strong>(2) for an example of the use of <strong>spu_create</strong>()</p>
