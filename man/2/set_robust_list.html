<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>get_robust_list, set_robust_list - get/set list of robust futexes</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;linux/futex.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;syscall.h&gt;

long get_robust_list(int pid, struct robust_list_head **head_ptr,
 size_t *len_ptr);
long set_robust_list(struct robust_list_head *head, size_t len);</code></pre>
<p><em>Note</em>: There are no glibc wrappers for these system calls; see NOTES.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These system calls deal with per-thread robust futex lists. These lists are managed in user space: the kernel knows only about the location of the head of the list. A thread can inform the kernel of the location of its robust futex list using <strong>set_robust_list</strong>(). The address of a thread's robust futex list can be obtained using <strong>get_robust_list</strong>().</p>
<p>The purpose of the robust futex list is to ensure that if a thread accidentally fails to unlock a futex before terminating or calling <strong>execve</strong>(2), another thread that is waiting on that futex is notified that the former owner of the futex has died. This notification consists of two pieces: the <strong>FUTEX_OWNER_DIED</strong> bit is set in the futex word, and the kernel performs a <strong>futex</strong>(2) <strong>FUTEX_WAKE</strong> operation on one of the threads waiting on the futex.</p>
<p>The <strong>get_robust_list</strong>() system call returns the head of the robust futex list of the thread whose thread ID is specified in <em>pid</em>. If <em>pid</em> is 0, the head of the list for the calling thread is returned. The list head is stored in the location pointed to by <em>head_ptr</em>. The size of the object pointed to by <em>**head_ptr</em> is stored in <em>len_ptr</em>.</p>
<p>Permission to employ <strong>get_robust_list</strong>() is governed by a ptrace access mode <strong>PTRACE_MODE_READ_REALCREDS</strong> check; see <strong>ptrace</strong>(2).</p>
<p>The <strong>set_robust_list</strong>() system call requests the kernel to record the head of the list of robust futexes owned by the calling thread. The <em>head</em> argument is the list head to record. The <em>len</em> argument should be <em>sizeof(*head)</em>.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>The <strong>set_robust_list</strong>() and <strong>get_robust_list</strong>() system calls return zero when the operation is successful, an error code otherwise.</p>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>
<p>The <strong>set_robust_list</strong>() system call can fail with the following error:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>EINVAL</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>len</em> does not equal <em>sizeof(struct robust_list_head)</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <strong>get_robust_list</strong>() system call can fail with the following errors:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>EFAULT</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The head of the robust futex list can't be stored at the location <em>head</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EPERM</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The calling process does not have permission to see the robust futex list of the thread with the thread ID <em>pid</em>, and does not have the <strong>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</strong> capability.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ESRCH</strong></dt>
<dd><p>No thread with the thread ID <em>pid</em> could be found.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>VERSIONS</h1>
<p>These system calls were added in Linux 2.6.17.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>These system calls are not needed by normal applications. No support for them is provided in glibc. In the unlikely event that you want to call them directly, use <strong>syscall</strong>(2).</p>
<p>A thread can have only one robust futex list; therefore applications that wish to use this functionality should use the robust mutexes provided by glibc.</p>
<p>In the initial implementation, a thread waiting on a futex was notified that the owner had died only if the owner terminated. Starting with Linux 2.6.28, notification was extended to include the case where the owner performs an <strong>execve</strong>(2).</p>
<p>The thread IDs mentioned in the main text are <em>kernel</em> thread IDs of the kind returned by <strong>clone</strong>(2) and <strong>gettid</strong>(2).</p>
