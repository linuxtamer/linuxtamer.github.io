<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>select, pselect - synchronous I/O multiplexing</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>See <strong>select</strong>(2)</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>select</strong>() and <strong>pselect</strong>() system calls are used to efficiently monitor multiple file descriptors, to see if any of them is, or becomes, "ready"; that is, to see whether I/O becomes possible, or an "exceptional condition" has occurred on any of the file descriptors.</p>
<p>This page provides background and tutorial information on the use of these system calls. For details of the arguments and semantics of <strong>select</strong>() and <strong>pselect</strong>(), see <strong>select</strong>(2).</p>
<h2>Combining signal and data events</h2>
<p><strong>pselect</strong>() is useful if you are waiting for a signal as well as for file descriptor(s) to become ready for I/O. Programs that receive signals normally use the signal handler only to raise a global flag. The global flag will indicate that the event must be processed in the main loop of the program. A signal will cause the <strong>select</strong>() (or <strong>pselect</strong>()) call to return with <em>errno</em> set to <strong>EINTR</strong>. This behavior is essential so that signals can be processed in the main loop of the program, otherwise <strong>select</strong>() would block indefinitely.</p>
<p>Now, somewhere in the main loop will be a conditional to check the global flag. So we must ask: what if a signal arrives after the conditional, but before the <strong>select</strong>() call? The answer is that <strong>select</strong>() would block indefinitely, even though an event is actually pending. This race condition is solved by the <strong>pselect</strong>() call. This call can be used to set the signal mask to a set of signals that are to be received only within the <strong>pselect</strong>() call. For instance, let us say that the event in question was the exit of a child process. Before the start of the main loop, we would block <strong>SIGCHLD</strong> using <strong>sigprocmask</strong>(2). Our <strong>pselect</strong>() call would enable <strong>SIGCHLD</strong> by using an empty signal mask. Our program would look like:</p>
<pre><code>static volatile sig_atomic_t got_SIGCHLD = 0;

static void
child_sig_handler(int sig)
{
    got_SIGCHLD = 1;
}

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    sigset_t sigmask, empty_mask;
    struct sigaction sa;
    fd_set readfds, writefds, exceptfds;
    int r;

    sigemptyset(&amp;sigmask);
    sigaddset(&amp;sigmask, SIGCHLD);
    if (sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &amp;sigmask, NULL) == -1) {
        perror(&quot;sigprocmask&quot;);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    sa.sa_flags = 0;
    sa.sa_handler = child_sig_handler;
    sigemptyset(&amp;sa.sa_mask);
    if (sigaction(SIGCHLD, &amp;sa, NULL) == -1) {
        perror(&quot;sigaction&quot;);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    sigemptyset(&amp;empty_mask);

    for (;;) {          /* main loop */
        /* Initialize readfds, writefds, and exceptfds
           before the pselect() call. (Code omitted.) */

        r = pselect(nfds, &amp;readfds, &amp;writefds, &amp;exceptfds,
                    NULL, &amp;empty_mask);
        if (r == -1 &amp;&amp; errno != EINTR) {
            /* Handle error */
        }

        if (got_SIGCHLD) {
            got_SIGCHLD = 0;

            /* Handle signalled event here; e.g., wait() for all
               terminated children. (Code omitted.) */
        }

        /* main body of program */
    }
}</code></pre>
<h2>Practical</h2>
<p>So what is the point of <strong>select</strong>()? Can't I just read and write to my file descriptors whenever I want? The point of <strong>select</strong>() is that it watches multiple descriptors at the same time and properly puts the process to sleep if there is no activity. UNIX programmers often find themselves in a position where they have to handle I/O from more than one file descriptor where the data flow may be intermittent. If you were to merely create a sequence of <strong>read</strong>(2) and <strong>write</strong>(2) calls, you would find that one of your calls may block waiting for data from/to a file descriptor, while another file descriptor is unused though ready for I/O. <strong>select</strong>() efficiently copes with this situation.</p>
<h2>Select law</h2>
<p>Many people who try to use <strong>select</strong>() come across behavior that is difficult to understand and produces nonportable or borderline results. For instance, the above program is carefully written not to block at any point, even though it does not set its file descriptors to nonblocking mode. It is easy to introduce subtle errors that will remove the advantage of using <strong>select</strong>(), so here is a list of essentials to watch for when using <strong>select</strong>().</p>
<dl>
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd><p>You should always try to use <strong>select</strong>() without a timeout. Your program should have nothing to do if there is no data available. Code that depends on timeouts is not usually portable and is difficult to debug.</p>
</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd><p>The value <em>nfds</em> must be properly calculated for efficiency as explained above.</p>
</dd>
<dt>3.</dt>
<dd><p>No file descriptor must be added to any set if you do not intend to check its result after the <strong>select</strong>() call, and respond appropriately. See next rule.</p>
</dd>
<dt>4.</dt>
<dd><p>After <strong>select</strong>() returns, all file descriptors in all sets should be checked to see if they are ready.</p>
</dd>
<dt>5.</dt>
<dd><p>The functions <strong>read</strong>(2), <strong>recv</strong>(2), <strong>write</strong>(2), and <strong>send</strong>(2) do <em>not</em> necessarily read/write the full amount of data that you have requested. If they do read/write the full amount, it's because you have a low traffic load and a fast stream. This is not always going to be the case. You should cope with the case of your functions managing to send or receive only a single byte.</p>
</dd>
<dt>6.</dt>
<dd><p>Never read/write only in single bytes at a time unless you are really sure that you have a small amount of data to process. It is extremely inefficient not to read/write as much data as you can buffer each time. The buffers in the example below are 1024 bytes although they could easily be made larger.</p>
</dd>
<dt>7.</dt>
<dd><p>Calls to <strong>read</strong>(2), <strong>recv</strong>(2), <strong>write</strong>(2), <strong>send</strong>(2), and <strong>select</strong>() can fail with the error <strong>EINTR</strong>, and calls to <strong>read</strong>(2), <strong>recv</strong>(2) <strong>write</strong>(2), and <strong>send</strong>(2) can fail with <em>errno</em> set to <strong>EAGAIN</strong> (<strong>EWOULDBLOCK</strong>). These results must be properly managed (not done properly above). If your program is not going to receive any signals, then it is unlikely you will get <strong>EINTR</strong>. If your program does not set nonblocking I/O, you will not get <strong>EAGAIN</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>8.</dt>
<dd><p>Never call <strong>read</strong>(2), <strong>recv</strong>(2), <strong>write</strong>(2), or <strong>send</strong>(2) with a buffer length of zero.</p>
</dd>
<dt>9.</dt>
<dd><p>If the functions <strong>read</strong>(2), <strong>recv</strong>(2), <strong>write</strong>(2), and <strong>send</strong>(2) fail with errors other than those listed in <strong>7.</strong>, or one of the input functions returns 0, indicating end of file, then you should <em>not</em> pass that file descriptor to <strong>select</strong>() again. In the example below, I close the file descriptor immediately, and then set it to -1 to prevent it being included in a set.</p>
</dd>
<dt>10.</dt>
<dd><p>The timeout value must be initialized with each new call to <strong>select</strong>(), since some operating systems modify the structure. <strong>pselect</strong>() however does not modify its timeout structure.</p>
</dd>
<dt>11.</dt>
<dd><p>Since <strong>select</strong>() modifies its file descriptor sets, if the call is being used in a loop, then the sets must be reinitialized before each call.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>See <strong>select</strong>(2).</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Generally speaking, all operating systems that support sockets also support <strong>select</strong>(). <strong>select</strong>() can be used to solve many problems in a portable and efficient way that naive programmers try to solve in a more complicated manner using threads, forking, IPCs, signals, memory sharing, and so on.</p>
<p>The <strong>poll</strong>(2) system call has the same functionality as <strong>select</strong>(), and is somewhat more efficient when monitoring sparse file descriptor sets. It is nowadays widely available, but historically was less portable than <strong>select</strong>().</p>
<p>The Linux-specific <strong>epoll</strong>(7) API provides an interface that is more efficient than <strong>select</strong>(2) and <strong>poll</strong>(2) when monitoring large numbers of file descriptors.</p>

<p>The above program properly forwards most kinds of TCP connections including OOB signal data transmitted by <strong>telnet</strong> servers. It handles the tricky problem of having data flow in both directions simultaneously. You might think it more efficient to use a <strong>fork</strong>(2) call and devote a thread to each stream. This becomes more tricky than you might suspect. Another idea is to set nonblocking I/O using <strong>fcntl</strong>(2). This also has its problems because you end up using inefficient timeouts.</p>
<p>The program does not handle more than one simultaneous connection at a time, although it could easily be extended to do this with a linked list of buffers—one for each connection. At the moment, new connections cause the current connection to be dropped.</p>
