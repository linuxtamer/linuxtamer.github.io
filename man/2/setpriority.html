<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>getpriority, setpriority - get/set program scheduling priority</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;</strong><br />
<strong>#include &lt;sys/resource.h&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>int getpriority(int </strong><em>which</em><strong>, id_t </strong><em>who</em><strong>);</strong><br />
<strong>int setpriority(int </strong><em>which</em><strong>, id_t </strong><em>who</em><strong>, int </strong><em>prio</em><strong>);</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The scheduling priority of the process, process group, or user, as indicated by <em>which</em> and <em>who</em> is obtained with the <strong>getpriority</strong>() call and set with the <strong>setpriority</strong>() call. The process attribute dealt with by these system calls is the same attribute (also known as the "nice" value) that is dealt with by <strong>nice</strong>(2).</p>
<p>The value <em>which</em> is one of <strong>PRIO_PROCESS</strong>, <strong>PRIO_PGRP</strong>, or <strong>PRIO_USER</strong>, and <em>who</em> is interpreted relative to <em>which</em> (a process identifier for <strong>PRIO_PROCESS</strong>, process group identifier for <strong>PRIO_PGRP</strong>, and a user ID for <strong>PRIO_USER</strong>). A zero value for <em>who</em> denotes (respectively) the calling process, the process group of the calling process, or the real user ID of the calling process.</p>
<p>The <em>prio</em> argument is a value in the range -20 to 19 (but see NOTES below). with -20 being the highest priority and 19 being the lowest priority. Attempts to set a priority outside this range are silently clamped to the range. The default priority is 0; lower values give a process a higher scheduling priority.</p>
<p>The <strong>getpriority</strong>() call returns the highest priority (lowest numerical value) enjoyed by any of the specified processes. The <strong>setpriority</strong>() call sets the priorities of all of the specified processes to the specified value.</p>
<p>Traditionally, only a privileged process could lower the nice value (i.e., set a higher priority). However, since Linux 2.6.12, an unprivileged process can decrease the nice value of a target process that has a suitable <strong>RLIMIT_NICE</strong> soft limit; see <strong>getrlimit</strong>(2) for details.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>On success, <strong>getpriority</strong>() returns the calling thread's nice value, which may be a negative number. On error, it returns -1 and sets <em>errno</em> to indicate the cause of the error.</p>
<p>Since a successful call to <strong>getpriority</strong>() can legitimately return the value -1, it is necessary to clear the external variable <em>errno</em> prior to the call, then check <em>errno</em> afterward to determine if -1 is an error or a legitimate value.</p>
<p><strong>setpriority</strong>() returns 0 on success. On error, it returns -1 and sets <em>errno</em> to indicate the cause of the error.</p>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>EINVAL</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>which</em> was not one of <strong>PRIO_PROCESS</strong>, <strong>PRIO_PGRP</strong>, or <strong>PRIO_USER</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ESRCH</strong></dt>
<dd><p>No process was located using the <em>which</em> and <em>who</em> values specified.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition to the errors indicated above, <strong>setpriority</strong>() may fail if:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>EACCES</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The caller attempted to set a lower nice value (i.e., a higher process priority), but did not have the required privilege (on Linux: did not have the <strong>CAP_SYS_NICE</strong> capability).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EPERM</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A process was located, but its effective user ID did not match either the effective or the real user ID of the caller, and was not privileged (on Linux: did not have the <strong>CAP_SYS_NICE</strong> capability). But see NOTES below.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.4BSD (these interfaces first appeared in 4.2BSD).</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>For further details on the nice value, see <strong>sched</strong>(7).</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: the addition of the "autogroup" feature in Linux 2.6.38 means that the nice value no longer has its traditional effect in many circumstances. For details, see <strong>sched</strong>(7).</p>
<p>A child created by <strong>fork</strong>(2) inherits its parent's nice value. The nice value is preserved across <strong>execve</strong>(2).</p>
<p>The details on the condition for <strong>EPERM</strong> depend on the system. The above description is what POSIX.1-2001 says, and seems to be followed on all System V-like systems. Linux kernels before 2.6.12 required the real or effective user ID of the caller to match the real user of the process <em>who</em> (instead of its effective user ID). Linux 2.6.12 and later require the effective user ID of the caller to match the real or effective user ID of the process <em>who</em>. All BSD-like systems (SunOS 4.1.3, Ultrix 4.2, 4.3BSD, FreeBSD 4.3, OpenBSD-2.5, ...) behave in the same manner as Linux 2.6.12 and later.</p>
<p>Including <em>&lt;sys/time.h&gt;</em> is not required these days, but increases portability. (Indeed, <em>&lt;sys/resource.h&gt;</em> defines the <em>rusage</em> structure with fields of type <em>struct timeval</em> defined in <em>&lt;sys/time.h&gt;</em>.)</p>
<h2>C library/kernel differences</h2>
<p>Within the kernel, nice values are actually represented using the range 40..1 (since negative numbers are error codes) and these are the values employed by the <strong>setpriority</strong>() and <strong>getpriority</strong>() system calls. The glibc wrapper functions for these system calls handle the translations between the user-land and kernel representations of the nice value according to the formula <em>unice = 20 - knice</em>. (Thus, the kernel's 40..1 range corresponds to the range -20..19 as seen by user space.)</p>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>According to POSIX, the nice value is a per-process setting. However, under the current Linux/NPTL implementation of POSIX threads, the nice value is a per-thread attribute: different threads in the same process can have different nice values. Portable applications should avoid relying on the Linux behavior, which may be made standards conformant in the future.</p>
