<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>getpid, getppid - get process identification</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;</strong><br />
<strong>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>pid_t getpid(void);</strong><br />
<strong>pid_t getppid(void);</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>getpid</strong>() returns the process ID (PID) of the calling process. (This is often used by routines that generate unique temporary filenames.)</p>
<p><strong>getppid</strong>() returns the process ID of the parent of the calling process. This will be either the ID of the process that created this process using <strong>fork</strong>(), or, if that process has already terminated, the ID of the process to which this process has been reparented (either <strong>init</strong>(1) or a "subreaper" process defined via the <strong>prctl</strong>(2) <strong>PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER</strong> operation).</p>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>
<p>These functions are always successful.</p>
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.3BSD, SVr4.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>If the caller's parent is in a different PID namespace (see <strong>pid_namespaces</strong>(7)), <strong>getppid</strong>() returns 0.</p>
<p>From a kernel perspective, the PID (which is shared by all of the threads in a multithreaded process) is sometimes also known as the thread group ID (TGID). This contrasts with the kernel thread ID (TID), which is unique for each thread. For further details, see <strong>gettid</strong>(2) and the discussion of the <strong>CLONE_THREAD</strong> flag in <strong>clone</strong>(2).</p>
<h2>C library/kernel differences</h2>
<p>From glibc version 2.3.4 up to and including version 2.24, the glibc wrapper function for <strong>getpid</strong>() cached PIDs, with the goal of avoiding additional system calls when a process calls <strong>getpid</strong>() repeatedly. Normally this caching was invisible, but its correct operation relied on support in the wrapper functions for <strong>fork</strong>(2), <strong>vfork</strong>(2), and <strong>clone</strong>(2): if an application bypassed the glibc wrappers for these system calls by using <strong>syscall</strong>(2), then a call to <strong>getpid</strong>() in the child would return the wrong value (to be precise: it would return the PID of the parent process). In addition, there were cases where <strong>getpid</strong>() could return the wrong value even when invoking <strong>clone</strong>(2) via the glibc wrapper function. (For a discussion of one such case, see BUGS in <strong>clone</strong>(2).) Furthermore, the complexity of the caching code had been the source of a few bugs within glibc over the years.</p>
<p>Because of the aforementioned problems, since glibc version 2.25, the PID cache is removed: calls to <strong>getpid</strong>() always invoke the actual system call, rather than returning a cached value.</p>
<p>On Alpha, instead of a pair of <strong>getpid</strong>() and <strong>getppid</strong>() system calls, a single <strong>getxpid</strong>() system call is provided, which returns a pair of PID and parent PID. The glibc <strong>getpid</strong>() and <strong>getppid</strong>() wrapper functions transparently deal with this. See <strong>syscall</strong>(2) for details regarding register mapping.</p>
