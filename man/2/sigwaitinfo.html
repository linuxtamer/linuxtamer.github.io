<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sigwaitinfo, sigtimedwait, rt_sigtimedwait - synchronously wait for queued signals</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;signal.h&gt;

int sigwaitinfo(const sigset_t *set, siginfo_t *info);

int sigtimedwait(const sigset_t *set, siginfo_t *info,
 const struct timespec *timeout);</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see <strong>feature_test_macros</strong>(7)):</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>sigwaitinfo</strong>(), <strong>sigtimedwait</strong>(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 199309L</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>sigwaitinfo</strong>() suspends execution of the calling thread until one of the signals in <em>set</em> is pending (If one of the signals in <em>set</em> is already pending for the calling thread, <strong>sigwaitinfo</strong>() will return immediately.)</p>
<p><strong>sigwaitinfo</strong>() removes the signal from the set of pending signals and returns the signal number as its function result. If the <em>info</em> argument is not NULL, then the buffer that it points to is used to return a structure of type <em>siginfo_t</em> (see <strong>sigaction</strong>(2)) containing information about the signal.</p>
<p>If multiple signals in <em>set</em> are pending for the caller, the signal that is retrieved by <strong>sigwaitinfo</strong>() is determined according to the usual ordering rules; see <strong>signal</strong>(7) for further details.</p>
<p><strong>sigtimedwait</strong>() operates in exactly the same way as <strong>sigwaitinfo</strong>() except that it has an additional argument, <em>timeout</em>, which specifies the interval for which the thread is suspended waiting for a signal. (This interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity, and kernel scheduling delays mean that the interval may overrun by a small amount.) This argument is of the following type:</p>
<pre><code>struct timespec {
    long    tv_sec;         /* seconds */
    long    tv_nsec;        /* nanoseconds */
}</code></pre>
<p>If both fields of this structure are specified as 0, a poll is performed: <strong>sigtimedwait</strong>() returns immediately, either with information about a signal that was pending for the caller, or with an error if none of the signals in <em>set</em> was pending.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>On success, both <strong>sigwaitinfo</strong>() and <strong>sigtimedwait</strong>() return a signal number (i.e., a value greater than zero). On failure both calls return -1, with <em>errno</em> set to indicate the error.</p>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>EAGAIN</strong></dt>
<dd><p>No signal in <em>set</em> was became pending within the <em>timeout</em> period specified to <strong>sigtimedwait</strong>().</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EINTR</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The wait was interrupted by a signal handler; see <strong>signal</strong>(7). (This handler was for a signal other than one of those in <em>set</em>.)</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EINVAL</strong></dt>
<dd><p><em>timeout</em> was invalid.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>In normal usage, the calling program blocks the signals in <em>set</em> via a prior call to <strong>sigprocmask</strong>(2) (so that the default disposition for these signals does not occur if they become pending between successive calls to <strong>sigwaitinfo</strong>() or <strong>sigtimedwait</strong>()) and does not establish handlers for these signals. In a multithreaded program, the signal should be blocked in all threads, in order to prevent the signal being treated according to its default disposition in a thread other than the one calling <strong>sigwaitinfo</strong>() or <strong>sigtimedwait</strong>()).</p>
<p>The set of signals that is pending for a given thread is the union of the set of signals that is pending specifically for that thread and the set of signals that is pending for the process as a whole (see <strong>signal</strong>(7)).</p>
<p>Attempts to wait for <strong>SIGKILL</strong> and <strong>SIGSTOP</strong> are silently ignored.</p>
<p>If multiple threads of a process are blocked waiting for the same signal(s) in <strong>sigwaitinfo</strong>() or <strong>sigtimedwait</strong>(), then exactly one of the threads will actually receive the signal if it becomes pending for the process as a whole; which of the threads receives the signal is indeterminate.</p>
<p><strong>sigwaitinfo</strong>() or <strong>sigtimedwait</strong>(), can't be used to receive signals that are synchronously generated, such as the <strong>SIGSEGV</strong> signal that results from accessing an invalid memory address or the <strong>SIGFPE</strong> signal that results from an arithmetic error. Such signals can be caught only via signal handler.</p>
<p>POSIX leaves the meaning of a NULL value for the <em>timeout</em> argument of <strong>sigtimedwait</strong>() unspecified, permitting the possibility that this has the same meaning as a call to <strong>sigwaitinfo</strong>(), and indeed this is what is done on Linux.</p>
<h2>C library/kernel differences</h2>
<p>On Linux, <strong>sigwaitinfo</strong>() is a library function implemented on top of <strong>sigtimedwait</strong>().</p>
<p>The glibc wrapper functions for <strong>sigwaitinfo</strong>() and <strong>sigtimedwait</strong>() silently ignore attempts to wait for the two real-time signals that are used internally by the NPTL threading implementation. See <strong>nptl</strong>(7) for details.</p>
<p>The original Linux system call was named <strong>sigtimedwait</strong>(). However, with the addition of real-time signals in Linux 2.2, the fixed-size, 32-bit <em>sigset_t</em> type supported by that system call was no longer fit for purpose. Consequently, a new system call, <strong>rt_sigtimedwait</strong>(), was added to support an enlarged <em>sigset_t</em> type. The new system call takes a fourth argument, <em>size_t sigsetsize</em>, which specifies the size in bytes of the signal set in <em>set</em>. This argument is currently required to have the value <em>sizeof(sigset_t)</em> (or the error <strong>EINVAL</strong> results). The glibc <strong>sigtimedwait</strong>() wrapper function hides these details from us, transparently calling <strong>rt_sigtimedwait</strong>() when the kernel provides it.</p>
