<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These system calls transfer data between the address space of the calling process ("the local process") and the process identified by <em>pid</em> ("the remote process"). The data moves directly between the address spaces of the two processes, without passing through kernel space.</p>
<p>The <strong>process_vm_readv</strong>() system call transfers data from the remote process to the local process. The data to be transferred is identified by <em>remote_iov</em> and <em>riovcnt</em>: <em>remote_iov</em> is a pointer to an array describing address ranges in the process <em>pid</em>, and <em>riovcnt</em> specifies the number of elements in <em>remote_iov</em>. The data is transferred to the locations specified by <em>local_iov</em> and <em>liovcnt</em>: <em>local_iov</em> is a pointer to an array describing address ranges in the calling process, and <em>liovcnt</em> specifies the number of elements in <em>local_iov</em>.</p>
<p>The <strong>process_vm_writev</strong>() system call is the converse of <strong>process_vm_readv</strong>()â€”it transfers data from the local process to the remote process. Other than the direction of the transfer, the arguments <em>liovcnt</em>, <em>local_iov</em>, <em>riovcnt</em>, and <em>remote_iov</em> have the same meaning as for <strong>process_vm_readv</strong>().</p>
<p>The <em>local_iov</em> and <em>remote_iov</em> arguments point to an array of <em>iovec</em> structures, defined in <em>&lt;sys/uio.h&gt;</em> as:</p>
<pre><code>struct iovec {
    void  *iov_base;    /* Starting address */
    size_t iov_len;     /* Number of bytes to transfer */
};</code></pre>
<p>Buffers are processed in array order. This means that <strong>process_vm_readv</strong>() completely fills <em>local_iov[0]</em> before proceeding to <em>local_iov[1]</em>, and so on. Likewise, <em>remote_iov[0]</em> is completely read before proceeding to <em>remote_iov[1]</em>, and so on.</p>
<p>Similarly, <strong>process_vm_writev</strong>() writes out the entire contents of <em>local_iov[0]</em> before proceeding to <em>local_iov[1]</em>, and it completely fills <em>remote_iov[0]</em> before proceeding to <em>remote_iov[1]</em>.</p>
<p>The lengths of <em>remote_iov[i].iov_len</em> and <em>local_iov[i].iov_len</em> do not have to be the same. Thus, it is possible to split a single local buffer into multiple remote buffers, or vice versa.</p>
<p>The <em>flags</em> argument is currently unused and must be set to 0.</p>
<p>The values specified in the <em>liovcnt</em> and <em>riovcnt</em> arguments must be less than or equal to <strong>IOV_MAX</strong> (defined in <em>&lt;limits.h&gt;</em> or accessible via the call <em>sysconf(_SC_IOV_MAX)</em>).</p>
<p>The count arguments and <em>local_iov</em> are checked before doing any transfers. If the counts are too big, or <em>local_iov</em> is invalid, or the addresses refer to regions that are inaccessible to the local process, none of the vectors will be processed and an error will be returned immediately.</p>
<p>Note, however, that these system calls do not check the memory regions in the remote process until just before doing the read/write. Consequently, a partial read/write (see RETURN VALUE) may result if one of the <em>remote_iov</em> elements points to an invalid memory region in the remote process. No further reads/writes will be attempted beyond that point. Keep this in mind when attempting to read data of unknown length (such as C strings that are null-terminated) from a remote process, by avoiding spanning memory pages (typically 4 KiB) in a single remote <em>iovec</em> element. (Instead, split the remote read into two <em>remote_iov</em> elements and have them merge back into a single write <em>local_iov</em> entry. The first read entry goes up to the page boundary, while the second starts on the next page boundary.)</p>
<p>Permission to read from or write to another process is governed by a ptrace access mode <strong>PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_REALCREDS</strong> check; see <strong>ptrace</strong>(2).</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>On success, <strong>process_vm_readv</strong>() returns the number of bytes read and <strong>process_vm_writev</strong>() returns the number of bytes written. This return value may be less than the total number of requested bytes, if a partial read/write occurred. (Partial transfers apply at the granularity of <em>iovec</em> elements. These system calls won't perform a partial transfer that splits a single <em>iovec</em> element.) The caller should check the return value to determine whether a partial read/write occurred.</p>
<p>On error, -1 is returned and <em>errno</em> is set appropriately.</p>
<h1>ERRORS</h1>

<h1>VERSIONS</h1>
<p>These system calls were added in Linux 3.2. Support is provided in glibc since version 2.15.</p>
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>These system calls are nonstandard Linux extensions.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>The data transfers performed by <strong>process_vm_readv</strong>() and <strong>process_vm_writev</strong>() are not guaranteed to be atomic in any way.</p>
<p>These system calls were designed to permit fast message passing by allowing messages to be exchanged with a single copy operation (rather than the double copy that would be required when using, for example, shared memory or pipes).</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>The following code sample demonstrates the use of <strong>process_vm_readv</strong>(). It reads 20 bytes at the address 0x10000 from the process with PID 10 and writes the first 10 bytes into <em>buf1</em> and the second 10 bytes into <em>buf2</em>.</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;sys/uio.h&gt;

int
main(void)
{
    struct iovec local[2];
    struct iovec remote[1];
    char buf1[10];
    char buf2[10];
    ssize_t nread;
    pid_t pid = 10;             /* PID of remote process */

    local[0].iov_base = buf1;
    local[0].iov_len = 10;
    local[1].iov_base = buf2;
    local[1].iov_len = 10;
    remote[0].iov_base = (void *) 0x10000;
    remote[0].iov_len = 20;

    nread = process_vm_readv(pid, local, 2, remote, 1, 0);
    if (nread != 20)
        return 1;
    else
        return 0;
}</code></pre>
