<p>is the configuration file for</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>file is a shell script that is sourced by</p>
<p>meaning that</p>
<p>must contain valid shell commands. Listed below are the standard</p>
<p>variables that may be set. If the values contain whitespace, wildcards or other special shell characters, ensure they are quoted and escaped correctly. See the</p>
<p>variable for an example on quoting.</p>
<p>After updating this file, you may wish to run</p>
<p>to apply the new configuration.</p>
<p>When a dynamically generated list is appended or prepended to, the whole is made unique where left-most wins.</p>
<p>Set to NO to disable</p>
<p>from running any subscribers. Defaults to YES.</p>
<p>If set, only these interfaces will be processed.</p>
<p>If set, these interfaces will not be processed.</p>
<p>These interfaces will always be processed first. If unset, defaults to the following:</p>
<p>lo lo[0-9]*</p>
<p>These interfaces will be processed next, unless they have a metric. If unset, defaults to the following:</p>
<p>tap[0-9]* tun[0-9]* vpn vpn[0-9]* wg[0-9]* ppp[0-9]* ippp[0-9]*</p>
<p>Ignore any exclusive marking for these interfaces. This is handy when 3rd party integrations force the</p>
<p>option and you want to disable it easily.</p>
<p>If unset, defaults to the following:</p>
<p>127.* 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 ::1</p>
<p>Prepend search domains to the dynamically generated list.</p>
<p>Append search domains to the dynamically generated list.</p>
<p>A list of domains to be removed from consideration. To remove a domain, you can use foo.* To remove a sub domain, you can use *.bar</p>
<p>Prepend name servers to the dynamically generated list. You should set this to 127.0.0.1 if you use a local name server other than libc.</p>
<p>Append name servers to the dynamically generated list.</p>
<p>A list of name servers to be removed from consideration. The default is 0.0.0.0 as some faulty routers send it via DHCP. To remove a block, you can use 192.168.*</p>
<p>These interfaces name servers will only be queried for the domains listed in their resolv.conf. Useful for VPN domains. Setting</p>
<p>will stop the forwarding of the root zone and allows the local resolver to recursively query the root servers directly. Requires a local nameserver other than libc. This is equivalent to the</p>
<p>option.</p>
<p>Force these interface to be public, overriding the private marking. This is handy when 3rd party integrations force the</p>
<p>option and you want to disable it easily.</p>
<p>Is a space separated list of replacement keywords. The syntax is this:</p>
<p>Example, given this resolv.conf:</p>
<p>domain foo.org search foo.org dead.beef nameserver 1.2.3.4 nameserver 2.3.4.5</p>
<p>and this configuration:</p>
<p>replace="search/foo*/bar.com" replace="$replace nameserver/1.2.3.4/5.6.7.8" replace="$replace nameserver/2.3.4.5/"</p>
<p>you would get this resolv.conf instead:</p>
<p>domain foo.org search bar.com nameserver 5.6.7.8</p>
<p>Works the same way as</p>
<p>except it works on each space separated value rather than the whole line, so it's useful for the replacing a single domain within the search directive. Using the same example resolv.conf and changing</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>you would get this resolv.conf instead:</p>
<p>domain foo.org search bar.com dead.beef nameserver 5.6.7.8</p>
<p>Override the default state directory of</p>
<p>This should not be changed once</p>
<p>is in use unless the old directory is copied to the new one.</p>
<p>The following variables affect</p>
<p>directly:-</p>
<p>Defaults to</p>
<p>if not set.</p>
<p>A list of libc resolver options, as specified in</p>
<p>When set to YES the latest resolv.conf is written to</p>
<p>without any alteration. When set to /dev/null or NULL,</p>
<p>is defaulted to NO,</p>
<p>is unset unless overridden and only the information set in</p>
<p>is written to</p>
<p>A libc resolver sortlist, as specified in</p>
<p>If a local name server is configured then the default is just to specify that and ignore all other entries as they will be configured for the local name server. Set this to NO to also list non-local nameservers. This will give you working DNS even if the local nameserver stops functioning at the expense of duplicated server queries.</p>
<p>Append name servers to the dynamically generated list.</p>
<p>Prepend name servers to the dynamically generated list.</p>
<p>Append search domains to the dynamically generated list.</p>
<p>Prepend search domains to the dynamically generated list.</p>
<p>openresolv ships with subscribers for the name servers</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Each subscriber can create configuration files which should be included in the subscribers main configuration file.</p>
<p>To disable a subscriber, simply set it's name to NO. For example, to disable the libc subscriber you would set:</p>
<p>libc=NO</p>
<p>This file tells dnsmasq which name servers to use for specific domains.</p>
<p>This file tells dnsmasq which name servers to use for global lookups.</p>
<p>Example resolvconf.conf for dnsmasq:</p>
<p>name_servers=127.0.0.1 dnsmasq_conf=/etc/dnsmasq-conf.conf dnsmasq_resolv=/etc/dnsmasq-resolv.conf</p>
<p>Example dnsmasq.conf:</p>
<p>listen-address=127.0.0.1 # If dnsmasq is compiled for DBus then we can take # advantage of not having to restart dnsmasq. enable-dbus conf-file=/etc/dnsmasq-conf.conf resolv-file=/etc/dnsmasq-resolv.conf</p>
<p>Include this file in the named options block. This file tells named which name servers to use for global lookups.</p>
<p>Include this file in the named global scope, after the options block. This file tells named which name servers to use for specific domains.</p>
<p>Example resolvconf.conf for named:</p>
<p>name_servers=127.0.0.1 named_options=/etc/named-options.conf named_zones=/etc/named-zones.conf</p>
<p>Example named.conf:</p>
<p>options { listen-on { 127.0.0.1; }; include "/etc/named-options.conf"; };</p>
<p>include "/etc/named-zones.conf";</p>
<p>This is the main pdnsd configuration file which we modify to add our forward domains to. If this variable is not set then we rely on the pdnsd configuration file setup to read</p>
<p>as documented below.</p>
<p>This file tells pdnsd about global name servers. If this variable is not set then it's written to</p>
<p>Example resolvconf.conf for pdnsd:</p>
<p>name_servers=127.0.0.1 pdnsd_conf=/etc/pdnsd.conf # pdnsd_resolv=/etc/pdnsd-resolv.conf</p>
<p>Example pdnsd.conf:</p>
<p>global { server_ip = 127.0.0.1; status_ctl = on; } server { # A server definition is required, even if empty. label="empty"; proxy_only=on; # file="/etc/pdnsd-resolv.conf"; }</p>
<p>This file tells pdns_recursor about specific and global name servers.</p>
<p>Example resolvconf.conf for pdns_recursor:</p>
<p>name_servers=127.0.0.1 pdns_zones=/etc/pdns/recursor-zones.conf</p>
<p>Example recursor.conf:</p>
<p>allow-from=127.0.0.0/8, ::1/128 forward-zones-file=/etc/pdns/recursor-zones.conf</p>
<p>This file tells unbound about specific and global name servers.</p>
<p>When set to YES, unbound marks the domains as insecure, thus ignoring DNSSEC.</p>
<p>Example resolvconf.conf for unbound:</p>
<p>name_servers=127.0.0.1 unbound_conf=/etc/unbound-resolvconf.conf</p>
<p>Example unbound.conf:</p>
<p>include: /etc/unbound-resolvconf.conf</p>
<p>Not all distributions store the files the subscribers need in the same locations. For example, named service scripts have been called named, bind and rc.bind and they could be located in a directory called /etc/rc.d, /etc/init.d or similar. Each subscriber attempts to automatically configure itself, but not every distribution has been catered for. Also, users could equally want to use a different version from the one installed by default, such as bind8 and bind9. To accommodate this, the subscribers have these files in configurable variables, documented below.</p>
<p>Name of the dnsmasq service.</p>
<p>Command to restart the dnsmasq service.</p>
<p>Location of the dnsmasq pidfile.</p>
<p>Name of the libc service.</p>
<p>Command to restart the libc service.</p>
<p>Name of the named service.</p>
<p>Command to restart the named service.</p>
<p>Command to restart the pdnsd service.</p>
<p>Command to restart the pdns_recursor service.</p>
<p>Command to restart the pdns_recursor service.</p>
<p>Name of the unbound service.</p>
<p>Command to restart the unbound service.</p>
<p>Location of the unbound pidfile.</p>
<p>Each distribution is a special snowflake and likes to name the same thing differently, namely the named service script.</p>
