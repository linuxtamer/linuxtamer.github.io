<p>The</p>
<p>library has some builtin commands, which affect the way that the line editing and history functions operate. These are based on similar named builtins present in the</p>
<p>shell.</p>
<p>The following builtin commands are available:</p>
<p>Without options and arguments, list all bound keys and macros, and the editor command or input string to which each one is bound. If only</p>
<p>is supplied, show the binding for that key or macro. If</p>
<p>is supplied, bind the editor</p>
<p>to that key or macro.</p>
<p>The options are as follows:</p>
<p>List or change key bindings in the</p>
<p>mode alternate (command mode) key map.</p>
<p>Bind all keys to the standard GNU Emacs-like bindings.</p>
<p>is interpreted as a symbolic arrow key name, which may be one of</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>List all editor commands and a short description of each.</p>
<p>Remove the binding of the key or macro</p>
<p>Define a keyboard macro rather than a key binding or command macro:</p>
<p>is taken as a literal string and appended to the input queue whenever</p>
<p>is typed. Bound keys and macros in</p>
<p>are themselves reinterpreted, and this continues for ten levels of interpretation.</p>
<p>Bind all keys to the standard</p>
<p>bindings.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>manual documents all editor commands and contains more information about macros and the input queue.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>can contain control characters of the form</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p>and the following backslashed escape sequences:</p>
<p>Bell</p>
<p>Backspace</p>
<p>Escape</p>
<p>Formfeed</p>
<p>Newline</p>
<p>Carriage return</p>
<p>Horizontal tab</p>
<p>Vertical tab</p>
<p>The ASCII character corresponding to the octal number</p>
<p>nullifies the special meaning of the following character, if it has any, notably</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Exercise terminal capabilities given in</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>the value of that capability is printed, with</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>indicating that the terminal does or does not have that capability.</p>
<p>returns an empty string for non-existent capabilities, rather than causing an error.</p>
<p>causes messages to be verbose.</p>
<p>Enable or disable the</p>
<p>functionality in a program.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>command lists all entries in the history. The</p>
<p>command sets the history size to</p>
<p>entries. The</p>
<p>command controls if history should keep duplicate entries. If</p>
<p>is non zero, only keep unique history entries. If</p>
<p>is zero, then keep all entries (the default).</p>
<p>Set the terminal capability</p>
<p>to</p>

<p>won't allow the user to change.</p>
