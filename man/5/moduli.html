<p>The</p>
<p>file contains prime numbers and generators for use by</p>
<p>in the Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange key exchange method.</p>
<p>New moduli may be generated with</p>
<p>using a two-step process. An initial</p>
<p>pass, using</p>
<p>calculates numbers that are likely to be useful. A second</p>
<p>pass, using</p>
<p>provides a high degree of assurance that the numbers are prime and are safe for use in Diffie-Hellman operations by</p>
<p>This</p>
<p>format is used as the output from each pass.</p>
<p>The file consists of newline-separated records, one per modulus, containing seven space-separated fields. These fields are as follows:</p>
<p>The time that the modulus was last processed as YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.</p>
<p>Decimal number specifying the internal structure of the prime modulus. Supported types are:</p>
<p>Unknown, not tested.</p>
<p>"Safe" prime; (p-1)/2 is also prime.</p>
<p>Sophie Germain; 2p+1 is also prime.</p>
<p>Moduli candidates initially produced by</p>
<p>are Sophie Germain primes (type 4). Further primality testing with</p>
<p>produces safe prime moduli (type 2) that are ready for use in</p>
<p>Other types are not used by OpenSSH.</p>
<p>Decimal number indicating the type of primality tests that the number has been subjected to represented as a bitmask of the following values:</p>
<p>Not tested.</p>
<p>Composite number â€“ not prime.</p>
<p>Sieve of Eratosthenes.</p>
<p>Probabilistic Miller-Rabin primality tests.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>moduli candidate generation uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes (flag 0x02). Subsequent</p>
<p>primality tests are Miller-Rabin tests (flag 0x04).</p>
<p>Decimal number indicating the number of primality trials that have been performed on the modulus.</p>
<p>Decimal number indicating the size of the prime in bits.</p>
<p>The recommended generator for use with this modulus (hexadecimal).</p>
<p>The modulus itself in hexadecimal.</p>
<p>When performing Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange,</p>
<p>first estimates the size of the modulus required to produce enough Diffie-Hellman output to sufficiently key the selected symmetric cipher.</p>
<p>then randomly selects a modulus from</p>
<p>that best meets the size requirement.</p>
