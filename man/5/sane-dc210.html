<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sane-dc210 - SANE backend for Kodak DC210 Digital Camera</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sane-dc210</strong> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to the Kodak DC210 camera. THIS IS EXTREMELY ALPHA CODE! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!</p>
<h1>DEVICE NAMES</h1>
<p>The current version of the backend only allows one camera to be connected. The device name is always "0".</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>The contents of the <em>dc210.conf</em> specify the serial port and baud rate to use. The baud rate specifies the maximum rate to use while downloading pictures. (The camera is always initialized using 9600 baud, then switches to the higher rate). On my 90MHz Pentium, I usually have no problems downloading at 115200 baud as long as the system is not excessively busy and the "interrupt-unmask flag" is set in the IDE driver (hdparm -u1). Supported baud rates are: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200.</p>
<p>The dumpinquiry line causes some information about the camera to be printed.</p>
<p>cmdrespause specifies how many usec (1,000,000ths of a) between writing the command and reading the result should be used. 125000 seems to be the lowest I could go reliably.</p>
<p>breakpause is the time in 1,000,000ths of a usec between sending the "back to default" break sending commands.</p>
<p>Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. A sample configuration file is shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>port=/dev/ttyS0<br />
# this is a comment<br />
baud=115200<br />
dumpinquiry<br />
cmdrespause=125000<br />
breakpause=1000000</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt><em>/etc/sane.d/dc210.conf</em></dt>
<dd><p>The backend configuration file (see also description of <strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> below).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-dc210.a</em></dt>
<dd><p>The static library implementing this backend.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-dc210.so</em></dt>
<dd><p>The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This environment variable specifies the list of directories that may contain the configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a semi-colon (`;'). If this variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in two default directories: first, the current working directory (".") and then in /etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then the default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories. For example, setting <strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched (in this order).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SANE_DEBUG_DC210</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If the library was compiled with debugging support enabled, this environment variable controls the debug level for this backend. A value of 128 requests maximally copious debug output; smaller levels reduce verbosity.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>SEE ALSO</h1>

<h1>AUTHOR</h1>
<p>Brian J. Murrell</p>
<p>This backend is based somewhat on the dc25 backend included in this package by Peter Fales.</p>
<p>The manpage was copied from the dc25 backend and somewhat edited by Henning Meier-Geinitz.</p>
