<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sane-canon630u - SANE backend for the Canon 630u USB flatbed scanner</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sane-canon630u</strong> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to the following Canon flatbed scanners:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CanoScan 630u<br />
CanoScan 636u<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Color scanning is supported at 75, 150, 300, and 600 dpi, and gamma and analog gain are adjustable.</p>
<p>TESTERS ARE WELCOME. Send your bug reports and comments to Nathan Rutman &lt;nthn1@yahoo.com&gt;</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>The contents of the <em>canon630u.conf</em> file is a list of device names that correspond to Canon USB scanners. Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. Only one device name can be listed in <em>canon630u.conf</em>. The program <em>sane-find-scanner</em> helps to find out the correct device. Under Linux, such a device name could be <em>/dev/usb/scanner0</em> for example. See sane-usb(5) for details.</p>
<p>This product-specific scanner driver uses the lower-level kernel USB driver "scanner". Check for "Driver=usbscanner" under /proc/bus/usb/devices. If "Driver=(none)", try forcing it with "insmod scanner vendor=0x04a9 product=0x2204"</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Due to Canon's unwillingness to provide scanner documentation, this software was developed by analyzing the USB traffic of the Windows 2000 driver. So things like the calibration procedure I kind of made up; it seems to work for my scanner. If you have complaints, let me know.</p>
<p>This driver requires the ability to send USB Control Messages, available in kernel 2.4.12 or later.</p>
<p>Some users have reported that this driver doesn't work at all. This seems to be a hardware specific issue, although I don't know what exactly the problem is. If you are having problems, please send me the info in /proc/bus/usb/devices, /proc/pci, the kernel scanner.c driver version from /var/log/messages, and the output from "SANE_DEBUG_CANON630U=12 scanimage &gt; /dev/null"</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt><em>/etc/sane.d/canon630u.conf</em></dt>
<dd><p>The backend configuration file (see also description of <strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> below).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-canon630u.a</em></dt>
<dd><p>The static library implementing this backend.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-canon630u.so</em></dt>
<dd><p>The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/tmp/canon.cal</em></dt>
<dd><p>The calibration file used to normalize pixel brightness. This is calculated every time the scanner is first used after it has lost power. Deleting this file will force recalibration.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This environment variable specifies the list of directories that may contain the configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a semi-colon (`;'). If this variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in two default directories: first, the current working directory (".") and then in /etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then the default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories. For example, setting <strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched (in this order).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SANE_DEBUG_CANON630U</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the debug level for this backend. Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Example:<br />
SANE_DEBUG_CANON630U=12 scanimage &gt; /dev/null</p>
