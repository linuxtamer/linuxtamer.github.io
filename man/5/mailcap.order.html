<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>/etc/mailcap.order - the mailcap ordering specifications</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The order of entries in the <em>/etc/mailcap</em> file can be altered by editing the <em>/etc/mailcap.order</em> file. Each line of that file specifies a package and an optional mime type. Mailcap entries that match will be placed in the order of this file. Entries that don't match will be placed later.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>mime-support:*/* gv:application/postscript netscape:text/html less:text/* emacs:text/*</p>
<p>The above would make any entries provided by the <strong>mime-support</strong> package (as found in the <em>/usr/lib/mime/packages</em> directory) take priority over everything else. The <strong>gv</strong> package will be used over anything else when it comes to postscript documents. <strong>Netscape</strong> will be used for any html documents and <strong>less</strong> will be used for any remaining text documents. However, since neither netscape or less provide for editing documents, any edit or compose actions will fall through to the <strong>emacs</strong> rules.</p>
<p>After modifying this file, be sure to run <em>/usr/sbin/update-mime</em> (as root) to propagate the changes into the <em>/etc/mailcap</em> file.</p>
<p>Remember that this files takes <em>package</em> names and not <em>executable</em> names. If you want to define rules that reference specific programs, the best way is to include them in <em>~/.mailcap</em> or the user section of the <em>/etc/mailcap</em> file.</p>
<h1>LIMITATIONS</h1>
<p>There is currently no way to break out a certain type from a wildcard rule. If, for example, both xv and gimp were to specify "image/*" rules, it isn't possible to use xv for <em>gif</em> images but use gimp for <em>jpeg</em> images.</p>
<p>Also, I would like to add the ability to specify certain actions in the rules. For example, if netscape were to have an <em>edit</em> rule but I wanted to use emacs for editing/creating html documents, I could place a line like</p>
<p>emacs:text/* action=edit|compose</p>
<p>before the netscape entry. The <strong>update-mime</strong> program would then spit out entries such that netscape <em>view</em> rule comes <strong>before</strong> the emacs <em>view</em> rule but have the netscape <em>edit</em> rule comes <strong>after</strong> the emacs <em>edit</em> rule.</p>
