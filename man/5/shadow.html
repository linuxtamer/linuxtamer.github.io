<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>shadow - shadowed password file</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>shadow is a file which contains the password information for the systems accounts and optional aging information.</p>
<p>This file must not be readable by regular users if password security is to be maintained.</p>
<p>Each line of this file contains 9 fields, separated by colons (“:”), in the following order:</p>
<p><strong>login name</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It must be a valid account name, which exist on the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>encrypted password</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This field may be empty, in which case no passwords are required to authenticate as the specified login name. However, some applications which read the /etc/shadow file may decide not to permit any access at all if the password field is empty.</p>
<p>A password field which starts with an exclamation mark means that the password is locked. The remaining characters on the line represent the password field before the password was locked.</p>
<p>Refer to <strong>crypt</strong>(3) for details on how this string is interpreted.</p>
<p>If the password field contains some string that is not a valid result of <strong>crypt</strong>(3), for instance ! or *, the user will not be able to use a unix password to log in (but the user may log in the system by other means).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>date of last password change</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The date of the last password change, expressed as the number of days since Jan 1, 1970.</p>
<p>The value 0 has a special meaning, which is that the user should change her password the next time she will log in the system.</p>
<p>An empty field means that password aging features are disabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>minimum password age</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The minimum password age is the number of days the user will have to wait before she will be allowed to change her password again.</p>
<p>An empty field and value 0 mean that there are no minimum password age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>maximum password age</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The maximum password age is the number of days after which the user will have to change her password.</p>
<p>After this number of days is elapsed, the password may still be valid. The user should be asked to change her password the next time she will log in.</p>
<p>An empty field means that there are no maximum password age, no password warning period, and no password inactivity period (see below).</p>
<p>If the maximum password age is lower than the minimum password age, the user cannot change her password.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>password warning period</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of days before a password is going to expire (see the maximum password age above) during which the user should be warned.</p>
<p>An empty field and value 0 mean that there are no password warning period.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>password inactivity period</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of days after a password has expired (see the maximum password age above) during which the password should still be accepted (and the user should update her password during the next login).</p>
<p>After expiration of the password and this expiration period is elapsed, no login is possible using the current users password. The user should contact her administrator.</p>
<p>An empty field means that there are no enforcement of an inactivity period.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>account expiration date</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The date of expiration of the account, expressed as the number of days since Jan 1, 1970.</p>
<p>Note that an account expiration differs from a password expiration. In case of an account expiration, the user shall not be allowed to login. In case of a password expiration, the user is not allowed to login using her password.</p>
<p>An empty field means that the account will never expire.</p>
<p>The value 0 should not be used as it is interpreted as either an account with no expiration, or as an expiration on Jan 1, 1970.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>reserved field</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This field is reserved for future use.</p>
</blockquote>
