<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>systemd.slice - Slice unit configuration</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><em>slice</em>.slice</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>A unit configuration file whose name ends in ".slice" encodes information about a slice unit. A slice unit is a concept for hierarchically managing resources of a group of processes. This management is performed by creating a node in the Linux Control Group (cgroup) tree. Units that manage processes (primarily scope and service units) may be assigned to a specific slice. For each slice, certain resource limits may be set that apply to all processes of all units contained in that slice. Slices are organized hierarchically in a tree. The name of the slice encodes the location in the tree. The name consists of a dash-separated series of names, which describes the path to the slice from the root slice. The root slice is named -.slice. Example: foo-bar.slice is a slice that is located within foo.slice, which in turn is located in the root slice -.slice.</p>
<p>Note that slice units cannot be templated, nor is possible to add multiple names to a slice unit by creating additional symlinks to its unit file.</p>
<p>By default, service and scope units are placed in system.slice, virtual machines and containers registered with <strong>systemd-machined</strong>(8) are found in machine.slice, and user sessions handled by <strong>systemd-logind</strong>(8) in user.slice. See <strong>systemd.special</strong>(7) for more information.</p>
<p>See <strong>systemd.unit</strong>(5) for the common options of all unit configuration files. The common configuration items are configured in the generic [Unit] and [Install] sections. The slice specific configuration options are configured in the [Slice] section. Currently, only generic resource control settings as described in <strong>systemd.resource-control</strong>(5) are allowed.</p>
<p>See the <strong>New Control Group Interfaces</strong>[1] for an introduction on how to make use of slice units from programs.</p>
<h1>AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCIES</h1>
<h2>Implicit Dependencies</h2>
<p>The following dependencies are implicitly added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Slice units automatically gain dependencies of type <em>After=</em> and <em>Requires=</em> on their immediate parent slice unit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Default Dependencies</h2>
<p>The following dependencies are added unless <em>DefaultDependencies=no</em> is set:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>Slice units will automatically have dependencies of type <em>Conflicts=</em> and <em>Before=</em> on shutdown.target. These ensure that slice units are removed prior to system shutdown. Only slice units involved with late system shutdown should disable <em>DefaultDependencies=</em> option.</p>
</blockquote>
