<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sane-dll - SANE dynamic backend loader</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sane-dll</strong> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to an arbitrary number of other SANE backends. These backends may either be pre-loaded at the time the <strong>sane-dll</strong> library is built or, on systems that support dynamic loading of shared libraries, the backends may be loaded at runtime. In the latter case, adding support for a new backend simply involves installing the relevant library in <em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane</em> and adding an entry to the <em>dll.conf</em> configuration file. In other words, no applications need to be modified or recompiled to add support for new devices.</p>
<h1>DEVICE NAMES</h1>
<p>This backend expects device names of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>backend</em>:<em>device</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where <em>backend</em> is the name of the backend and <em>device</em> is the name of the device in this backend that should be addressed. If the device name does not contain a colon (:), then the entire string is treated as the <em>device</em> string for the default backend. The default backend is the backend listed last in the configuration file (see below) or the first pre-loaded backend (if any).</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>The contents of the <em>dll.conf</em> file is a list of backend names that may be loaded dynamically upon demand. Empty lines are ignored, also everything after a hash mark (#). A sample configuration file is shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>net<br />
# this is a comment<br />
pnm<br />
mustek</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also possible to add a file in <em>/etc/sane.d/dll.d</em> that contains the list of backends to be added. Backends mentioned in a file included in this directory will be added before any backends listed in <em>dll.conf.</em> Files in <em>/etc/sane.d/dll.d</em> can be freely named. They shall follow the format conventions as apply for <em>dll.conf.</em></p>
<p>Note that backends that were pre-loaded when building this library do not have to be listed in this configuration file. That is, if a backend was preloaded, then that backend will always be present, regardless of whether it's listed in the configuration file or not.</p>
<p>The list of preloaded backends is determined by macro <strong>PRELOADABLE_BACKENDS</strong> in file backend/Makefile.in of the SANE source code distribution. After changing the value of this macro, it is necessary to reconfigure, rebuild, and reinstall SANE for the change to take effect.</p>
<p>Aliases are defined in the config file <em>dll.aliases</em>. It can contain entries of the form</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br />
alias SomeName SaneDeviceName<br />
alias "Some Name" SaneDeviceName<br />
hide SaneDeviceName</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br />
alias Epson net:somehost:epson:/dev/sgX<br />
alias "Siemens ST400" st400:/dev/sgY<br />
hide net:somehost:pnm:0<br />
hide net:somehost:pnm:1<br />
alias "Read from file" pnm:0<br />
hide pnm:1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aliased device names are automatically hidden.</p>
<p>The idea is that users don't have to deal with complicated device names (especially for networked devices), and to hide other exported devices which might confuse them. Note that a hidden device can still be accessed if the device name is known, it just doesn't appear on the list.</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt><em>/etc/sane.d/dll.aliases</em></dt>
<dd><p>The list of aliased or hidden backends.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/etc/sane.d/dll.conf</em></dt>
<dd><p>The backend configuration file (see also description of <strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> below).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-dll.a</em></dt>
<dd><p>The static library implementing this backend.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-dll.so</em></dt>
<dd><p>The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This environment variable specifies the list of directories that may contain the configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a semi-colon (`;'). If this variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in two default directories: first, the current working directory (".") and then in /etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then the default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories. For example, setting <strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched (in this order).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SANE_DEBUG_DLL</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels reduce verbosity.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<pre><code>Value  Description
0      print severe errors only
1      print normal errors and important messages
2      print normal messages
3      print debugging messages
4      print everything</code></pre>
<p>Example: export SANE_DEBUG_DLL=3</p>
