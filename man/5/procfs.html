<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>proc - process information pseudo-filesystem</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>proc</strong> filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem which provides an interface to kernel data structures. It is commonly mounted at <em>/proc</em>. Typically, it is mounted automatically by the system, but it can also be mounted manually using a command such as:</p>
<pre><code>mount -t proc proc /proc</code></pre>
<p>Most of the files in the <strong>proc</strong> filesystem are read-only, but some files are writable, allowing kernel variables to be changed.</p>
<h2>Mount options</h2>
<p>The <strong>proc</strong> filesystem supports the following mount options:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>hidepid</strong>=<em>n</em> (since Linux 3.3)</dt>
<dd><p>This option controls who can access the information in <em>/proc/[pid]</em> directories. The argument, <em>n</em>, is one of the following values:</p>
<dl>
<dt>0</dt>
<dd><p>Everybody may access all <em>/proc/[pid]</em> directories. This is the traditional behavior, and the default if this mount option is not specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt>1</dt>
<dd><p>Users may not access files and subdirectories inside any <em>/proc/[pid]</em> directories but their own (the <em>/proc/[pid]</em> directories themselves remain visible). Sensitive files such as <em>/proc/[pid]/cmdline</em> and <em>/proc/[pid]/status</em> are now protected against other users. This makes it impossible to learn whether any user is running a specific program (so long as the program doesn't otherwise reveal itself by its behavior).</p>
</dd>
<dt>2</dt>
<dd><p>As for mode 1, but in addition the <em>/proc/[pid]</em> directories belonging to other users become invisible. This means that <em>/proc/[pid]</em> entries can no longer be used to discover the PIDs on the system. This doesn't hide the fact that a process with a specific PID value exists (it can be learned by other means, for example, by "kill -0 $PID"), but it hides a process's UID and GID, which could otherwise be learned by employing <strong>stat</strong>(2) on a <em>/proc/[pid]</em> directory. This greatly complicates an attacker's task of gathering information about running processes (e.g., discovering whether some daemon is running with elevated privileges, whether another user is running some sensitive program, whether other users are running any program at all, and so on).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><strong>gid</strong>=<em>gid</em> (since Linux 3.3)</dt>
<dd><p>Specifies the ID of a group whose members are authorized to learn process information otherwise prohibited by <strong>hidepid</strong> (i.e., users in this group behave as though <em>/proc</em> was mounted with <em>hidepid=0</em>). This group should be used instead of approaches such as putting nonroot users into the <strong>sudoers</strong>(5) file.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Underneath <em>/proc</em>, there are the following general groups of files and subdirectories:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]</em> subdirectories</dt>
<dd><p>Each one of these subdirectories contains files and subdirectories exposing information about the process with the corresponding process ID.</p>
<p>Underneath each of the <em>/proc/[pid]</em> directories, a <em>task</em> subdirectory contains subdirectories of the form <em>task/[tid]</em>, which contain corresponding information about each of the threads in the process, where <em>tid</em> is the kernel thread ID of the thread.</p>
<p>The <em>/proc/[pid]</em> subdirectories are visible when iterating through <em>/proc</em> with <strong>getdents</strong>(2) (and thus are visible when one uses <strong>ls</strong>(1) to view the contents of <em>/proc</em>).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[tid]</em> subdirectories</dt>
<dd><p>Each one of these subdirectories contains files and subdirectories exposing information about the thread with the corresponding thread ID. The contents of these directories are the same as the corresponding <em>/proc/[pid]/task/[tid]</em> directories.</p>
<p>The <em>/proc/[tid]</em> subdirectories are <em>not</em> visible when iterating through <em>/proc</em> with <strong>getdents</strong>(2) (and thus are <em>not</em> visible when one uses <strong>ls</strong>(1) to view the contents of <em>/proc</em>).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/self</em></dt>
<dd><p>When a process accesses this magic symbolic link, it resolves to the process's own <em>/proc/[pid]</em> directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/thread-self</em></dt>
<dd><p>When a thread accesses this magic symbolic link, it resolves to the process's own <em>/proc/self/task/[tid]</em> directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[a-z]*</em></dt>
<dd><p>Various other files and subdirectories under <em>/proc</em> expose system-wide information.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>All of the above are described in more detail below.</p>
<h2>Files and directories</h2>
<p>The following list provides details of many of the files and directories under the <em>/proc</em> hierarchy.</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]</em></dt>
<dd><p>There is a numerical subdirectory for each running process; the subdirectory is named by the process ID. Each <em>/proc/[pid]</em> subdirectory contains the pseudo-files and directories described below.</p>
<p>The files inside each <em>/proc/[pid]</em> directory are normally owned by the effective user and effective group ID of the process. However, as a security measure, the ownership is made <em>root:root</em> if the process's "dumpable" attribute is set to a value other than 1.</p>
<p>Before Linux 4.11, <em>root:root</em> meant the "global" root user ID and group ID (i.e., UID 0 and GID 0 in the initial user namespace). Since Linux 4.11, if the process is in a noninitial user namespace that has a valid mapping for user (group) ID 0 inside the namespace, then the user (group) ownership of the files under <em>/proc/[pid]</em> is instead made the same as the root user (group) ID of the namespace. This means that inside a container, things work as expected for the container "root" user.</p>
<p>The process's "dumpable" attribute may change for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The attribute was explicitly set via the <strong>prctl</strong>(2) <strong>PR_SET_DUMPABLE</strong> operation.</p></li>
<li><p>The attribute was reset to the value in the file <em>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</em> (described below), for the reasons described in <strong>prctl</strong>(2).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Resetting the "dumpable" attribute to 1 reverts the ownership of the <em>/proc/[pid]/*</em> files to the process's effective UID and GID. Note, however, that if the effective UID or GID is subsequently modified, then the "dumpable" attribute may be reset, as described in <strong>prctl</strong>(2). Therefore, it may be desirable to reset the "dumpable" attribute <em>after</em> making any desired changes to the process's effective UID or GID.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/attr</em></dt>
<dd><p>The files in this directory provide an API for security modules. The contents of this directory are files that can be read and written in order to set security-related attributes. This directory was added to support SELinux, but the intention was that the API be general enough to support other security modules. For the purpose of explanation, examples of how SELinux uses these files are provided below.</p>
<p>This directory is present only if the kernel was configured with <strong>CONFIG_SECURITY</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/attr/current</em> (since Linux 2.6.0)</dt>
<dd><p>The contents of this file represent the current security attributes of the process.</p>
<p>In SELinux, this file is used to get the security context of a process. Prior to Linux 2.6.11, this file could not be used to set the security context (a write was always denied), since SELinux limited process security transitions to <strong>execve</strong>(2) (see the description of <em>/proc/[pid]/attr/exec</em>, below). Since Linux 2.6.11, SELinux lifted this restriction and began supporting "set" operations via writes to this node if authorized by policy, although use of this operation is only suitable for applications that are trusted to maintain any desired separation between the old and new security contexts.</p>
<p>Prior to Linux 2.6.28, SELinux did not allow threads within a multithreaded process to set their security context via this node as it would yield an inconsistency among the security contexts of the threads sharing the same memory space. Since Linux 2.6.28, SELinux lifted this restriction and began supporting "set" operations for threads within a multithreaded process if the new security context is bounded by the old security context, where the bounded relation is defined in policy and guarantees that the new security context has a subset of the permissions of the old security context.</p>
<p>Other security modules may choose to support "set" operations via writes to this node.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/attr/exec</em> (since Linux 2.6.0)</dt>
<dd><p>This file represents the attributes to assign to the process upon a subsequent <strong>execve</strong>(2).</p>
<p>In SELinux, this is needed to support role/domain transitions, and <strong>execve</strong>(2) is the preferred point to make such transitions because it offers better control over the initialization of the process in the new security label and the inheritance of state. In SELinux, this attribute is reset on <strong>execve</strong>(2) so that the new program reverts to the default behavior for any <strong>execve</strong>(2) calls that it may make. In SELinux, a process can set only its own <em>/proc/[pid]/attr/exec</em> attribute.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/attr/fscreate</em> (since Linux 2.6.0)</dt>
<dd><p>This file represents the attributes to assign to files created by subsequent calls to <strong>open</strong>(2), <strong>mkdir</strong>(2), <strong>symlink</strong>(2), and <strong>mknod</strong>(2)</p>
<p>SELinux employs this file to support creation of a file (using the aforementioned system calls) in a secure state, so that there is no risk of inappropriate access being obtained between the time of creation and the time that attributes are set. In SELinux, this attribute is reset on <strong>execve</strong>(2), so that the new program reverts to the default behavior for any file creation calls it may make, but the attribute will persist across multiple file creation calls within a program unless it is explicitly reset. In SELinux, a process can set only its own <em>/proc/[pid]/attr/fscreate</em> attribute.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/attr/keycreate</em> (since Linux 2.6.18)</dt>
<dd><p>If a process writes a security context into this file, all subsequently created keys (<strong>add_key</strong>(2)) will be labeled with this context. For further information, see the kernel source file <em>Documentation/security/keys/core.rst</em> (or file <em>Documentation/security/keys.txt</em> on Linux between 3.0 and 4.13, or <em>Documentation/keys.txt</em> before Linux 3.0).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/attr/prev</em> (since Linux 2.6.0)</dt>
<dd><p>This file contains the security context of the process before the last <strong>execve</strong>(2); that is, the previous value of <em>/proc/[pid]/attr/current</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/attr/socketcreate</em> (since Linux 2.6.18)</dt>
<dd><p>If a process writes a security context into this file, all subsequently created sockets will be labeled with this context.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/autogroup</em> (since Linux 2.6.38)</dt>
<dd><p>See <strong>sched</strong>(7).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/auxv</em> (since 2.6.0)</dt>
<dd><p>This contains the contents of the ELF interpreter information passed to the process at exec time. The format is one <em>unsigned long</em> ID plus one <em>unsigned long</em> value for each entry. The last entry contains two zeros. See also <strong>getauxval</strong>(3).</p>
<p>Permission to access this file is governed by a ptrace access mode <strong>PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS</strong> check; see <strong>ptrace</strong>(2).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/cgroup</em> (since Linux 2.6.24)</dt>
<dd><p>See <strong>cgroups</strong>(7).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/clear_refs</em> (since Linux 2.6.22)</dt>
<dd><p>This is a write-only file, writable only by owner of the process.</p>
<p>The following values may be written to the file:</p>
<dl>
<dt>1 (since Linux 2.6.22)</dt>
<dd><p>Reset the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits for all the pages associated with the process. (Before kernel 2.6.32, writing any nonzero value to this file had this effect.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>2 (since Linux 2.6.32)</dt>
<dd><p>Reset the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits for all anonymous pages associated with the process.</p>
</dd>
<dt>3 (since Linux 2.6.32)</dt>
<dd><p>Reset the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits for all file-mapped pages associated with the process.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Clearing the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits provides a method to measure approximately how much memory a process is using. One first inspects the values in the "Referenced" fields for the VMAs shown in <em>/proc/[pid]/smaps</em> to get an idea of the memory footprint of the process. One then clears the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits and, after some measured time interval, once again inspects the values in the "Referenced" fields to get an idea of the change in memory footprint of the process during the measured interval. If one is interested only in inspecting the selected mapping types, then the value 2 or 3 can be used instead of 1.</p>
<p>Further values can be written to affect different properties:</p>
<dl>
<dt>4 (since Linux 3.11)</dt>
<dd><p>Clear the soft-dirty bit for all the pages associated with the process. This is used (in conjunction with <em>/proc/[pid]/pagemap</em>) by the check-point restore system to discover which pages of a process have been dirtied since the file <em>/proc/[pid]/clear_refs</em> was written to.</p>
</dd>
<dt>5 (since Linux 4.0)</dt>
<dd><p>Reset the peak resident set size ("high water mark") to the process's current resident set size value.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Writing any value to <em>/proc/[pid]/clear_refs</em> other than those listed above has no effect.</p>
<p>The <em>/proc/[pid]/clear_refs</em> file is present only if the <strong>CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR</strong> kernel configuration option is enabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/cmdline</em></dt>
<dd><p>This read-only file holds the complete command line for the process, unless the process is a zombie. In the latter case, there is nothing in this file: that is, a read on this file will return 0 characters. The command-line arguments appear in this file as a set of strings separated by null bytes ('\0'), with a further null byte after the last string.</p>
<p>If, after an <strong>execve</strong>(2), the process modifies its <em>argv</em> strings, those changes will show up here. This is not the same thing as modifying the <em>argv</em> array.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a process may change the memory location that this file refers via <strong>prctl</strong>(2) operations such as <strong>PR_SET_MM_ARG_START</strong>.</p>
<p>Think of this file as the command line that the process wants you to see.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/comm</em> (since Linux 2.6.33)</dt>
<dd><p>This file exposes the process's <em>comm</em> value—that is, the command name associated with the process. Different threads in the same process may have different <em>comm</em> values, accessible via <em>/proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/comm</em>. A thread may modify its <em>comm</em> value, or that of any of other thread in the same thread group (see the discussion of <strong>CLONE_THREAD</strong> in <strong>clone</strong>(2)), by writing to the file <em>/proc/self/task/[tid]/comm</em>. Strings longer than <strong>TASK_COMM_LEN</strong> (16) characters (including the terminating null byte) are silently truncated.</p>
<p>This file provides a superset of the <strong>prctl</strong>(2) <strong>PR_SET_NAME</strong> and <strong>PR_GET_NAME</strong> operations, and is employed by <strong>pthread_setname_np</strong>(3) when used to rename threads other than the caller. The value in this file is used for the <em>%e</em> specifier in <em>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</em>; see <strong>core</strong>(5).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/coredump_filter</em> (since Linux 2.6.23)</dt>
<dd><p>See <strong>core</strong>(5).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/cpuset</em> (since Linux 2.6.12)</dt>
<dd><p>See <strong>cpuset</strong>(7).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/cwd</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is a symbolic link to the current working directory of the process. To find out the current working directory of process 20, for instance, you can do this:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd /proc/20/cwd; pwd -P</code></pre>
<p>In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link are not available if the main thread has already terminated (typically by calling <strong>pthread_exit</strong>(3)).</p>
<p>Permission to dereference or read (<strong>readlink</strong>(2)) this symbolic link is governed by a ptrace access mode <strong>PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS</strong> check; see <strong>ptrace</strong>(2).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/environ</em></dt>
<dd><p>This file contains the initial environment that was set when the currently executing program was started via <strong>execve</strong>(2). The entries are separated by null bytes ('\0'), and there may be a null byte at the end. Thus, to print out the environment of process 1, you would do:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat /proc/1/environ | tr &#39;\000&#39; &#39;\n&#39;</code></pre>
<p>If, after an <strong>execve</strong>(2), the process modifies its environment (e.g., by calling functions such as <strong>putenv</strong>(3) or modifying the <strong>environ</strong>(7) variable directly), this file will <em>not</em> reflect those changes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a process may change the memory location that this file refers via <strong>prctl</strong>(2) operations such as <strong>PR_SET_MM_ENV_START</strong>.</p>
<p>Permission to access this file is governed by a ptrace access mode <strong>PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS</strong> check; see <strong>ptrace</strong>(2).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/exe</em></dt>
<dd><p>Under Linux 2.2 and later, this file is a symbolic link containing the actual pathname of the executed command. This symbolic link can be dereferenced normally; attempting to open it will open the executable. You can even type <em>/proc/[pid]/exe</em> to run another copy of the same executable that is being run by process [pid]. If the pathname has been unlinked, the symbolic link will contain the string '(deleted)' appended to the original pathname. In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link are not available if the main thread has already terminated (typically by calling <strong>pthread_exit</strong>(3)).</p>
<p>Permission to dereference or read (<strong>readlink</strong>(2)) this symbolic link is governed by a ptrace access mode <strong>PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS</strong> check; see <strong>ptrace</strong>(2).</p>
<p>Under Linux 2.0 and earlier, <em>/proc/[pid]/exe</em> is a pointer to the binary which was executed, and appears as a symbolic link. A <strong>readlink</strong>(2) call on this file under Linux 2.0 returns a string in the format:</p>
<p>[device]:inode</p>
<p>For example, [0301]:1502 would be inode 1502 on device major 03 (IDE, MFM, etc. drives) minor 01 (first partition on the first drive).</p>
<p><strong>find</strong>(1) with the <em>-inum</em> option can be used to locate the file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/fd/</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the process has open, named by its file descriptor, and which is a symbolic link to the actual file. Thus, 0 is standard input, 1 standard output, 2 standard error, and so on.</p>
<p>For file descriptors for pipes and sockets, the entries will be symbolic links whose content is the file type with the inode. A <strong>readlink</strong>(2) call on this file returns a string in the format:</p>
<p>type:[inode]</p>
<p>For example, <em>socket:[2248868]</em> will be a socket and its inode is 2248868. For sockets, that inode can be used to find more information in one of the files under <em>/proc/net/</em>.</p>
<p>For file descriptors that have no corresponding inode (e.g., file descriptors produced by <strong>bpf</strong>(2), <strong>epoll_create</strong>(2), <strong>eventfd</strong>(2), <strong>inotify_init</strong>(2), <strong>perf_event_open</strong>(2), <strong>signalfd</strong>(2), <strong>timerfd_create</strong>(2), and <strong>userfaultfd</strong>(2)), the entry will be a symbolic link with contents of the form</p>
<p>anon_inode:&lt;file-type&gt;</p>
<p>In many cases (but not all), the <em>file-type</em> is surrounded by square brackets.</p>
<p>For example, an epoll file descriptor will have a symbolic link whose content is the string <em>anon_inode:[eventpoll]</em>.</p>
<p>In a multithreaded process, the contents of this directory are not available if the main thread has already terminated (typically by calling <strong>pthread_exit</strong>(3)).</p>
<p>Programs that take a filename as a command-line argument, but don't take input from standard input if no argument is supplied, and programs that write to a file named as a command-line argument, but don't send their output to standard output if no argument is supplied, can nevertheless be made to use standard input or standard output by using <em>/proc/[pid]/fd</em> files as command-line arguments. For example, assuming that <em>-i</em> is the flag designating an input file and <em>-o</em> is the flag designating an output file:</p>
<pre><code>$ foobar -i /proc/self/fd/0 -o /proc/self/fd/1 ...</code></pre>
<p>and you have a working filter.</p>
<p><em>/proc/self/fd/N</em> is approximately the same as <em>/dev/fd/N</em> in some UNIX and UNIX-like systems. Most Linux MAKEDEV scripts symbolically link <em>/dev/fd</em> to <em>/proc/self/fd</em>, in fact.</p>
<p>Most systems provide symbolic links <em>/dev/stdin</em>, <em>/dev/stdout</em>, and <em>/dev/stderr</em>, which respectively link to the files <em>0</em>, <em>1</em>, and <em>2</em> in <em>/proc/self/fd</em>. Thus the example command above could be written as:</p>
<pre><code>$ foobar -i /dev/stdin -o /dev/stdout ...</code></pre>
<p>Permission to dereference or read (<strong>readlink</strong>(2)) the symbolic links in this directory is governed by a ptrace access mode <strong>PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS</strong> check; see <strong>ptrace</strong>(2).</p>
<p>Note that for file descriptors referring to inodes (pipes and sockets, see above), those inodes still have permission bits and ownership information distinct from those of the <em>/proc/[pid]/fd</em> entry, and that the owner may differ from the user and group IDs of the process. An unprivileged process may lack permissions to open them, as in this example:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo test | sudo -u nobody cat
test
$ echo test | sudo -u nobody cat /proc/self/fd/0
cat: /proc/self/fd/0: Permission denied</code></pre>
<p>File descriptor 0 refers to the pipe created by the shell and owned by that shell's user, which is not <em>nobody</em>, so <strong>cat</strong> does not have permission to create a new file descriptor to read from that inode, even though it can still read from its existing file descriptor 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/fdinfo/</em> (since Linux 2.6.22)</dt>
<dd><p>This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the process has open, named by its file descriptor. The files in this directory are readable only by the owner of the process. The contents of each file can be read to obtain information about the corresponding file descriptor. The content depends on the type of file referred to by the corresponding file descriptor.</p>
<p>For regular files and directories, we see something like:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat /proc/12015/fdinfo/4
pos:    1000
flags:  01002002
mnt_id: 21</code></pre>
<p>The fields are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pos</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is a decimal number showing the file offset.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>flags</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is an octal number that displays the file access mode and file status flags (see <strong>open</strong>(2)). If the close-on-exec file descriptor flag is set, then <em>flags</em> will also include the value <strong>O_CLOEXEC</strong>.</p>
<p>Before Linux 3.1, this field incorrectly displayed the setting of <strong>O_CLOEXEC</strong> at the time the file was opened, rather than the current setting of the close-on-exec flag.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>mnt_id</em> This field, present since Linux 3.15, is the ID of the mount point containing this file. See the description of <em>/proc/[pid]/mountinfo</em>.</p>
<p>For eventfd file descriptors (see <strong>eventfd</strong>(2)), we see (since Linux 3.8) the following fields:</p>
<pre><code>pos:	0
flags:	02
mnt_id:	10
eventfd-count:               40</code></pre>
<p><em>eventfd-count</em> is the current value of the eventfd counter, in hexadecimal.</p>
<p>For epoll file descriptors (see <strong>epoll</strong>(7)), we see (since Linux 3.8) the following fields:</p>
<pre><code>pos:	0
flags:	02
mnt_id:	10
tfd:        9 events:       19 data: 74253d2500000009
tfd:        7 events:       19 data: 74253d2500000007</code></pre>
<p>Each of the lines beginning <em>tfd</em> describes one of the file descriptors being monitored via the epoll file descriptor (see <strong>epoll_ctl</strong>(2) for some details). The <em>tfd</em> field is the number of the file descriptor. The <em>events</em> field is a hexadecimal mask of the events being monitored for this file descriptor. The <em>data</em> field is the data value associated with this file descriptor.</p>
<p>For signalfd file descriptors (see <strong>signalfd</strong>(2)), we see (since Linux 3.8) the following fields:</p>
<pre><code>pos:	0
flags:	02
mnt_id:	10
sigmask:	0000000000000006</code></pre>
<p><em>sigmask</em> is the hexadecimal mask of signals that are accepted via this signalfd file descriptor. (In this example, bits 2 and 3 are set, corresponding to the signals <strong>SIGINT</strong> and <strong>SIGQUIT</strong>; see <strong>signal</strong>(7).)</p>
<p>For inotify file descriptors (see <strong>inotify</strong>(7)), we see (since Linux 3.8) the following fields:</p>
<pre><code>pos:	0
flags:	00
mnt_id:	11
inotify wd:2 ino:7ef82a sdev:800001 mask:800afff ignored_mask:0 fhandle-bytes:8 fhandle-type:1 f_handle:2af87e00220ffd73
inotify wd:1 ino:192627 sdev:800001 mask:800afff ignored_mask:0 fhandle-bytes:8 fhandle-type:1 f_handle:27261900802dfd73</code></pre>
<p>Each of the lines beginning with "inotify" displays information about one file or directory that is being monitored. The fields in this line are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>wd</em></dt>
<dd><p>A watch descriptor number (in decimal).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>ino</em></dt>
<dd><p>The inode number of the target file (in hexadecimal).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>sdev</em></dt>
<dd><p>The ID of the device where the target file resides (in hexadecimal).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>mask</em></dt>
<dd><p>The mask of events being monitored for the target file (in hexadecimal).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the kernel was built with exportfs support, the path to the target file is exposed as a file handle, via three hexadecimal fields: <em>fhandle-bytes</em>, <em>fhandle-type</em>, and <em>f_handle</em>.</p>
<p>For fanotify file descriptors (see <strong>fanotify</strong>(7)), we see (since Linux 3.8) the following fields:</p>

</dd>
<dt><em>ticks</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is the number of timer expirations that have occurred, (i.e., the value that <strong>read</strong>(2) on it would return).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>settime flags</em></dt>
<dd><p>This field lists the flags with which the timerfd was last armed (see <strong>timerfd_settime</strong>(2)), in octal (in this example, both <strong>TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME</strong> and <strong>TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET</strong> are set).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>it_value</em></dt>
<dd><p>This field contains the amount of time until the timer will next expire, expressed in seconds and nanoseconds. This is always expressed as a relative value, regardless of whether the timer was created using the <strong>TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME</strong> flag.</p>

<dd><p>The number of bytes which this task has caused to be read from storage. This is simply the sum of bytes which this process passed to <strong>read</strong>(2) and similar system calls.

</dd>

<dd><p>The big inaccuracy here is truncate. If a process writes 1 MB to a file and then deletes the file, it will in fact perform no writeout.

<p>The <em>address</em> field is the address space in the process that the mapping occupies. The <em>perms</em> field is a set of permissions:</p>
<pre><code>r = read
w = write
x = execute
s = shared
p = private (copy on write)</code></pre>
<p>The <em>offset</em> field is the offset into the file/whatever; <em>dev</em> is the device (major:minor); <em>inode</em> is the inode on that device. 0 indicates that no inode is associated with the memory region, as would be the case with BSS (uninitialized data).</p>
<p>The <em>pathname</em> field will usually be the file that is backing the mapping. For ELF files, you can easily coordinate with the <em>offset</em> field by looking at the Offset field in the ELF program headers (<em>readelf -l</em>).</p>
<p>There are additional helpful pseudo-paths:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>[stack]</em></dt>
<dd><p>The initial process's (also known as the main thread's) stack.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>[stack:&lt;tid&gt;]</em> (from Linux 3.4 to 4.4)</dt>
<dd><p>A thread's stack (where the <em>&lt;tid&gt;</em> is a thread ID). It corresponds to the <em>/proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/</em> path. This field was removed in Linux 4.5, since providing this information for a process with large numbers of threads is expensive.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>[vdso]</em></dt>
<dd><p>The virtual dynamically linked shared object. See <strong>vdso</strong>(7).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>[heap]</em></dt>
<dd><p>The process's heap.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the <em>pathname</em> field is blank, this is an anonymous mapping as obtained via <strong>mmap</strong>(2). There is no easy way to coordinate this back to a process's source, short of running it through <strong>gdb</strong>(1), <strong>strace</strong>(1), or similar.</p>
<p><em>pathname</em> is shown unescaped except for newline characters, which are replaced with an octal escape sequence. As a result, it is not possible to determine whether the original pathname contained a newline character or the literal <em>\012</em> character sequence.</p>
<p>If the mapping is file-backed and the file has been deleted, the string " (deleted)" is appended to the pathname. Note that this is ambiguous too.</p>
<p>Under Linux 2.0, there is no field giving pathname.</p>

<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/mountinfo</em> (since Linux 2.6.26)</dt>
<dd><p>This file contains information about mount points in the process's mount namespace (see <strong>mount_namespaces</strong>(7)). It supplies various information (e.g., propagation state, root of mount for bind mounts, identifier for each mount and its parent) that is missing from the (older) <em>/proc/[pid]/mounts</em> file, and fixes various other problems with that file (e.g., nonextensibility, failure to distinguish per-mount versus per-superblock options).</p>
<p>The file contains lines of the form:</p>

</dd>
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd><p>parent ID: the ID of the parent mount (or of self for the root of this mount namespace's mount tree).</p>
<p>If a new mount is stacked on top of a previous existing mount (so that it hides the existing mount) at pathname P, then the parent of the new mount is the previous mount at that location. Thus, when looking at all the mounts stacked at a particular location, the top-most mount is the one that is not the parent of any other mount at the same location. (Note, however, that this top-most mount will be accessible only if the longest path subprefix of P that is a mount point is not itself hidden by a stacked mount.)</p>
<p>If the parent mount point lies outside the process's root directory (see <strong>chroot</strong>(2)), the ID shown here won't have a corresponding record in <em>mountinfo</em> whose mount ID (field 1) matches this parent mount ID (because mount points that lie outside the process's root directory are not shown in <em>mountinfo</em>). As a special case of this point, the process's root mount point may have a parent mount (for the initramfs filesystem) that lies outside the process's root directory, and an entry for that mount point will not appear in <em>mountinfo</em>.</p>

<dd><p>This file can be used to adjust the score used to select which process should be killed in an out-of-memory (OOM) situation. The kernel uses this value for a bit-shift operation of the process's <em>oom_score</em> value: valid values are in the range -16 to +15, plus the special value -17, which disables OOM-killing altogether for this process. A positive score increases the likelihood of this process being killed by the OOM-killer; a negative score decreases the likelihood.</p>
<p>The default value for this file is 0; a new process inherits its parent's <em>oom_adj</em> setting. A process must be privileged (<strong>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</strong>) to update this file.</p>
<p>Since Linux 2.6.36, use of this file is deprecated in favor of <em>/proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/oom_score</em> (since Linux 2.6.11)</dt>
<dd><p>This file displays the current score that the kernel gives to this process for the purpose of selecting a process for the OOM-killer. A higher score means that the process is more likely to be selected by the OOM-killer. The basis for this score is the amount of memory used by the process, with increases (+) or decreases (-) for factors including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>whether the process is privileged (-).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Before kernel 2.6.36 the following factors were also used in the calculation of oom_score:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>whether the process creates a lot of children using <strong>fork</strong>(2) (+);</p></li>
<li><p>whether the process has been running a long time, or has used a lot of CPU time (-);</p></li>
<li><p>whether the process has a low nice value (i.e., &gt; 0) (+); and</p></li>
<li><p>whether the process is making direct hardware access (-).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>oom_score</em> also reflects the adjustment specified by the <em>oom_score_adj</em> or <em>oom_adj</em> setting for the process.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj</em> (since Linux 2.6.36)</dt>
<dd><p>This file can be used to adjust the badness heuristic used to select which process gets killed in out-of-memory conditions.</p>
<p>The badness heuristic assigns a value to each candidate task ranging from 0 (never kill) to 1000 (always kill) to determine which process is targeted. The units are roughly a proportion along that range of allowed memory the process may allocate from, based on an estimation of its current memory and swap use. For example, if a task is using all allowed memory, its badness score will be 1000. If it is using half of its allowed memory, its score will be 500.</p>
<p>There is an additional factor included in the badness score: root processes are given 3% extra memory over other tasks.</p>
<p>The amount of "allowed" memory depends on the context in which the OOM-killer was called. If it is due to the memory assigned to the allocating task's cpuset being exhausted, the allowed memory represents the set of mems assigned to that cpuset (see <strong>cpuset</strong>(7)). If it is due to a mempolicy's node(s) being exhausted, the allowed memory represents the set of mempolicy nodes. If it is due to a memory limit (or swap limit) being reached, the allowed memory is that configured limit. Finally, if it is due to the entire system being out of memory, the allowed memory represents all allocatable resources.</p>
<p>The value of <em>oom_score_adj</em> is added to the badness score before it is used to determine which task to kill. Acceptable values range from -1000 (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MIN) to +1000 (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MAX). This allows user space to control the preference for OOM-killing, ranging from always preferring a certain task or completely disabling it from OOM killing. The lowest possible value, -1000, is equivalent to disabling OOM-killing entirely for that task, since it will always report a badness score of 0.</p>
<p>Consequently, it is very simple for user space to define the amount of memory to consider for each task. Setting an <em>oom_score_adj</em> value of +500, for example, is roughly equivalent to allowing the remainder of tasks sharing the same system, cpuset, mempolicy, or memory controller resources to use at least 50% more memory. A value of -500, on the other hand, would be roughly equivalent to discounting 50% of the task's allowed memory from being considered as scoring against the task.</p>
<p>For backward compatibility with previous kernels, <em>/proc/[pid]/oom_adj</em> can still be used to tune the badness score. Its value is scaled linearly with <em>oom_score_adj</em>.</p>
<p>Writing to <em>/proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj</em> or <em>/proc/[pid]/oom_adj</em> will change the other with its scaled value.</p>
<p>The <strong>choom</strong>(1) program provides a command-line interface for adjusting the <em>oom_score_adj</em> value of a running process or a newly executed command.</p>

<dd><p>UNIX and Linux support the idea of a per-process root of the filesystem, set by the <strong>chroot</strong>(2) system call. This file is a symbolic link that points to the process's root directory, and behaves in the same way as <em>exe</em>, and <em>fd/*</em>.</p>
<p>Note however that this file is not merely a symbolic link. It provides the same view of the filesystem (including namespaces and the set of per-process mounts) as the process itself. An example illustrates this point. In one terminal, we start a shell in new user and mount namespaces, and in that shell we create some new mount points:</p>
<pre><code>$ PS1=&#39;sh1# &#39; unshare -Urnm
sh1# mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /etc  # Mount empty tmpfs at /etc
sh1# mount --bind /usr /dev     # Mount /usr at /dev
sh1# echo $$
27123</code></pre>
<p>In a second terminal window, in the initial mount namespace, we look at the contents of the corresponding mounts in the initial and new namespaces:</p>
<pre><code>$ PS1=&#39;sh2# &#39; sudo sh
sh2# ls /etc | wc -l                  # In initial NS
309
sh2# ls /proc/27123/root/etc | wc -l  # /etc in other NS
0                                     # The empty tmpfs dir
sh2# ls /dev | wc -l                  # In initial NS
205
sh2# ls /proc/27123/root/dev | wc -l  # /dev in other NS
11                                    # Actually bind
                                      # mounted to /usr

<p>The first of these lines shows the same information as is displayed for the mapping in <em>/proc/[pid]/maps</em>. The following lines show the size of the mapping, the amount of the mapping that is currently resident in RAM ("Rss"), the process's proportional share of this mapping ("Pss"), the number of clean and dirty shared pages in the mapping, and the number of clean and dirty private pages in the mapping. "Referenced" indicates the amount of memory currently marked as referenced or accessed. "Anonymous" shows the amount of memory that does not belong to any file. "Swap" shows how much would-be-anonymous memory is also used, but out on swap.</p>
<p>The "KernelPageSize" line (available since Linux 2.6.29) is the page size used by the kernel to back the virtual memory area. This matches the size used by the MMU in the majority of cases. However, one counter-example occurs on PPC64 kernels whereby a kernel using 64 kB as a base page size may still use 4 kB pages for the MMU on older processors. To distinguish the two attributes, the "MMUPageSize" line (also available since Linux 2.6.29) reports the page size used by the MMU.</p>
<p>The "Locked" indicates whether the mapping is locked in memory or not.</p>
<p>The "ProtectionKey" line (available since Linux 4.9, on x86 only) contains the memory protection key (see <strong>pkeys</strong>(7)) associated with the virtual memory area. This entry is present only if the kernel was built with the <strong>CONFIG_X86_INTEL_MEMORY_PROTECTION_KEYS</strong> configuration option (since Linux 4.6).</p>
<p>The "VmFlags" line (available since Linux 3.8) represents the kernel flags associated with the virtual memory area, encoded using the following two-letter codes:</p>
<p>rd - readable wr - writable ex - executable sh - shared mr - may read mw - may write me - may execute ms - may share gd - stack segment grows down pf - pure PFN range dw - disabled write to the mapped file lo - pages are locked in memory io - memory mapped I/O area sr - sequential read advise provided rr - random read advise provided dc - do not copy area on fork de - do not expand area on remapping ac - area is accountable nr - swap space is not reserved for the area ht - area uses huge tlb pages sf - perform synchronous page faults (since Linux 4.15) nl - non-linear mapping (removed in Linux 4.0) ar - architecture specific flag wf - wipe on fork (since Linux 4.14) dd - do not include area into core dump sd - soft-dirty flag (since Linux 3.13) mm - mixed map area hg - huge page advise flag nh - no-huge page advise flag mg - mergeable advise flag um - userfaultfd missing pages tracking (since Linux 4.3) uw - userfaultfd wprotect pages tracking (since Linux 4.3)</p>

For processes running under a non-real-time scheduling policy, this is the raw nice value (<strong>setpriority</strong>(2)) as represented in the kernel. The kernel stores nice values as numbers in the range 0 (high) to 39 (low), corresponding to the user-visible nice range of -20 to 19.</p>

<p>Within each of these subdirectories, there is a set of files with the same names and contents as under the <em>/proc/[pid]</em> directories.

For attributes that are distinct for each thread, the corresponding files under <em>task/[tid]</em> may have different values (e.g., various fields in each of the <em>task/[tid]/status</em> files may be different for each thread), or they might not exist in <em>/proc/[pid]</em> at all.</p>

<p>This option is intended for use by the checkpoint-restore (CRIU) system, and reliably provides a list of children only if all of the child processes are stopped or frozen. It does not work properly if children of the target task exit while the file is being read! Exiting children may cause non-exiting children to be omitted from the list. This makes this interface even more unreliable than classic PID-based approaches if the inspected task and its children aren't frozen, and most code should probably not use this interface.</p>

ID: 0
signal: 60/00007fff86e452a8
notify: signal/pid.2634
ClockID: 1</code></pre>
<p>The lines shown for each timer have the following meanings:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>ID</em></dt>
<dd><p>The ID for this timer. This is not the same as the timer ID returned by <strong>timer_create</strong>(2); rather, it is the same kernel-internal ID that is available via the <em>si_timerid</em> field of the <em>siginfo_t</em> structure (see <strong>sigaction</strong>(2)).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>signal</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is the signal number that this timer uses to deliver notifications followed by a slash, and then the <em>sigev_value</em> value supplied to the signal handler. Valid only for timers that notify via a signal.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>notify</em></dt>
<dd><p>The part before the slash specifies the mechanism that this timer uses to deliver notifications, and is one of "thread", "signal", or "none". Immediately following the slash is either the string "tid" for timers with <strong>SIGEV_THREAD_ID</strong> notification, or "pid" for timers that notify by other mechanisms. Following the "." is the PID of the process (or the kernel thread ID of the thread) that will be delivered a signal if the timer delivers notifications via a signal.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>ClockID</em></dt>
<dd><p>This field identifies the clock that the timer uses for measuring time. For most clocks, this is a number that matches one of the user-space <strong>CLOCK_*</strong> constants exposed via <em>&lt;time.h&gt;</em>. <strong>CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID</strong> timers display with a value of -6 in this field. <strong>CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID</strong> timers display with a value of -2 in this field.</p>

<dd><p>This file exposes the process's "current" timer slack value, expressed in nanoseconds. The file is writable, allowing the process's timer slack value to be changed. Writing 0 to this file resets the "current" timer slack to the "default" timer slack value. For further details, see the discussion of <strong>PR_SET_TIMERSLACK</strong> in <strong>prctl</strong>(2).</p>
<p>Initially, permission to access this file was governed by a ptrace access mode <strong>PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_FSCREDS</strong> check (see <strong>ptrace</strong>(2)). However, this was subsequently deemed too strict a requirement (and had the side effect that requiring a process to have the <strong>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</strong> capability would also allow it to view and change any process's memory). Therefore, since Linux 4.9, only the (weaker) <strong>CAP_SYS_NICE</strong> capability is required to access this file.</p>

</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/[tid]</em></dt>
<dd><p>There is a numerical subdirectory for each running thread that is not a thread group leader (i.e., a thread whose thread ID is not the same as its process ID); the subdirectory is named by the thread ID. Each one of these subdirectories contains files and subdirectories exposing information about the thread with the thread ID <em>tid</em>. The contents of these directories are the same as the corresponding <em>/proc/[pid]/task/[tid]</em> directories.</p>
<p>The <em>/proc/[tid]</em> subdirectories are <em>not</em> visible when iterating through <em>/proc</em> with <strong>getdents</strong>(2) (and thus are <em>not</em> visible when one uses <strong>ls</strong>(1) to view the contents of <em>/proc</em>). However, the pathnames of these directories are visible to (i.e., usable as arguments in) system calls that operate on pathnames.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/apm</em></dt>
<dd><p>Advanced power management version and battery information when <strong>CONFIG_APM</strong> is defined at kernel compilation time.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/buddyinfo</em></dt>
<dd><p>This file contains information which is used for diagnosing memory fragmentation issues. Each line starts with the identification of the node and the name of the zone which together identify a memory region. This is then followed by the count of available chunks of a certain order in which these zones are split. The size in bytes of a certain order is given by the formula:</p>
<p>(2^order) * PAGE_SIZE</p>
<p>The binary buddy allocator algorithm inside the kernel will split one chunk into two chunks of a smaller order (thus with half the size) or combine two contiguous chunks into one larger chunk of a higher order (thus with double the size) to satisfy allocation requests and to counter memory fragmentation. The order matches the column number, when starting to count at zero.</p>
<p>For example on an x86-64 system:</p>
<pre><code>Node 0, zone     DMA     1    1    1    0    2    1    1    0    1    1    3
Node 0, zone   DMA32    65   47    4   81   52   28   13   10    5    1  404
Node 0, zone  Normal   216   55  189  101   84   38   37   27    5    3  587</code></pre>
<p>In this example, there is one node containing three zones and there are 11 different chunk sizes. If the page size is 4 kilobytes, then the first zone called <em>DMA</em> (on x86 the first 16 megabyte of memory) has 1 chunk of 4 kilobytes (order 0) available and has 3 chunks of 4 megabytes (order 10) available.</p>
<p>If the memory is heavily fragmented, the counters for higher order chunks will be zero and allocation of large contiguous areas will fail.</p>

<dt><em>/proc/loadavg</em></dt>
<dd><p>The first three fields in this file are load average figures giving the number of jobs in the run queue (state R) or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged over 1, 5, and 15 minutes. They are the same as the load average numbers given by <strong>uptime</strong>(1) and other programs. The fourth field consists of two numbers separated by a slash (/). The first of these is the number of currently runnable kernel scheduling entities (processes, threads). The value after the slash is the number of kernel scheduling entities that currently exist on the system. The fifth field is the PID of the process that was most recently created on the system.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/locks</em></dt>
<dd><p>This file shows current file locks (<strong>flock</strong>(2) and <strong>fcntl</strong>(2)) and leases (<strong>fcntl</strong>(2)).</p>
<p>An example of the content shown in this file is the following:</p>
<pre><code>1: POSIX  ADVISORY  READ  5433 08:01:7864448 128 128
2: FLOCK  ADVISORY  WRITE 2001 08:01:7864554 0 EOF
3: FLOCK  ADVISORY  WRITE 1568 00:2f:32388 0 EOF
4: POSIX  ADVISORY  WRITE 699 00:16:28457 0 EOF

8: OFDLCK ADVISORY  WRITE -1 08:01:8713209 128 191</code></pre>
<p>The fields shown in each line are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The ordinal position of the lock in the list.</p></li>
<li><p>The lock type. Values that may appear here include:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>FLOCK</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is a BSD file lock created using <strong>flock</strong>(2).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>OFDLCK</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is an open file description (OFD) lock created using <strong>fcntl</strong>(2).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>POSIX</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is a POSIX byte-range lock created using <strong>fcntl</strong>(2).</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><p>Among the strings that can appear here are the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>ADVISORY</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is an advisory lock.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MANDATORY</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is a mandatory lock.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><p>The type of lock. Values that can appear here are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>READ</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is a POSIX or OFD read lock, or a BSD shared lock.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>WRITE</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is a POSIX or OFD write lock, or a BSD exclusive lock.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><p>The PID of the process that owns the lock.</p>
<p>Because OFD locks are not owned by a single process (since multiple processes may have file descriptors that refer to the same open file description), the value -1 is displayed in this field for OFD locks. (Before kernel 4.14, a bug meant that the PID of the process that initially acquired the lock was displayed instead of the value -1.)</p></li>
<li><p>Three colon-separated subfields that identify the major and minor device ID of the device containing the filesystem where the locked file resides, followed by the inode number of the locked file.</p></li>
<li><p>The byte offset of the first byte of the lock. For BSD locks, this value is always 0.</p></li>
<li><p>The byte offset of the last byte of the lock. <strong>EOF</strong> in this field means that the lock extends to the end of the file. For BSD locks, the value shown is always <em>EOF</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Since Linux 4.9, the list of locks shown in <em>/proc/locks</em> is filtered to show just the locks for the processes in the PID namespace (see <strong>pid_namespaces</strong>(7)) for which the <em>/proc</em> filesystem was mounted. (In the initial PID namespace, there is no filtering of the records shown in this file.)</p>
<p>The <strong>lslocks</strong>(8) command provides a bit more information about each lock.</p>

</dd>
<dt><em>Committed_AS</em> %lu</dt>
<dd><p>The amount of memory presently allocated on the system. The committed memory is a sum of all of the memory which has been allocated by processes, even if it has not been "used" by them as of yet. A process which allocates 1 GB of memory (using <strong>malloc</strong>(3) or similar), but touches only 300 MB of that memory will show up as using only 300 MB of memory even if it has the address space allocated for the entire 1 GB.</p>
<p>This 1 GB is memory which has been "committed" to by the VM and can be used at any time by the allocating application. With strict overcommit enabled on the system (mode 2 in <em>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</em>), allocations which would exceed the <em>CommitLimit</em> will not be permitted. This is useful if one needs to guarantee that processes will not fail due to lack of memory once that memory has been successfully allocated.</p>

<p>Reading these files will usually show driver and host configuration, statistics, and so on.</p>
<p>Writing to these files allows different things on different hosts. For example, with the <em>latency</em> and <em>nolatency</em> commands, root can switch on and off command latency measurement code in the eata_dma driver.

If the number of allocated file handles is close to the maximum, you should consider increasing the maximum. Before Linux 2.6, the kernel allocated file handles dynamically, but it didn't free them again. Instead the free file handles were kept in a list for reallocation; the "free file handles" value indicates the size of that list. A large number of free file handles indicates that there was a past peak in the usage of open file handles. Since Linux 2.6, the kernel does deallocate freed file handles, and the "free file handles" value is always zero.</p>

Setting the value to 1 prevents a longstanding class of security issues caused by hard-link-based time-of-check, time-of-use races, most commonly seen in world-writable directories such as <em>/tmp</em>. The common method of exploiting this flaw is to cross privilege boundaries when following a given hard link (i.e., a root process follows a hard link created by another user). Additionally, on systems without separated partitions, this stops unauthorized users from "pinning" vulnerable set-user-ID and set-group-ID files against being upgraded by the administrator, or linking to special files.</p>

<dd><p>When the value in this file is 0, no restrictions are placed on following symbolic links (i.e., this is the historical behavior before Linux 3.6). When the value in this file is 1, symbolic links are followed only in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the filesystem UID of the process following the link matches the owner (UID) of the symbolic link (as described in <strong>credentials</strong>(7), a process's filesystem UID is normally the same as its effective UID);</p></li>

<dd><p>The value in this file is assigned to a process's "dumpable" flag in the circumstances described in <strong>prctl</strong>(2). In effect, the value in this file determines whether core dump files are produced for set-user-ID or otherwise protected/tainted binaries. The "dumpable" setting also affects the ownership of files in a process's <em>/proc/[pid]</em> directory, as described above.</p>
<p>Three different integer values can be specified:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>0 (default)</em></dt>
<dd><p>This provides the traditional (pre-Linux 2.6.13) behavior. A core dump will not be produced for a process which has changed credentials (by calling <strong>seteuid</strong>(2), <strong>setgid</strong>(2), or similar, or by executing a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program) or whose binary does not have read permission enabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>1 ("debug")</em></dt>
<dd><p>All processes dump core when possible. (Reasons why a process might nevertheless not dump core are described in <strong>core</strong>(5).) The core dump is owned by the filesystem user ID of the dumping process and no security is applied. This is intended for system debugging situations only: this mode is insecure because it allows unprivileged users to examine the memory contents of privileged processes.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>2 ("suidsafe")</em></dt>
<dd><p>Any binary which normally would not be dumped (see "0" above) is dumped readable by root only. This allows the user to remove the core dump file but not to read it. For security reasons core dumps in this mode will not overwrite one another or other files. This mode is appropriate when administrators are attempting to debug problems in a normal environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, since Linux 3.6, <em>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</em> must either be an absolute pathname or a pipe command, as detailed in <strong>core</strong>(5). Warnings will be written to the kernel log if <em>core_pattern</em> does not follow these rules, and no core dump will be produced.</p>

<dd><p>This file defines the amount of free memory (in KiB) on the system that should be reserved for users with the capability <strong>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</strong>.</p>
<p>The default value in this file is the minimum of [3% of free pages, 8MiB] expressed as KiB. The default is intended to provide enough for the superuser to log in and kill a process, if necessary, under the default overcommit 'guess' mode (i.e., 0 in <em>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</em>).</p>
<p>Systems running in "overcommit never" mode (i.e., 2 in <em>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</em>) should increase the value in this file to account for the full virtual memory size of the programs used to recover (e.g., <strong>login</strong>(1) <strong>ssh</strong>(1), and <strong>top</strong>(1)) Otherwise, the superuser may not be able to log in to recover the system.

In some cases (like the page still having a valid copy on disk), the kernel will handle the failure transparently without affecting any applications. But if there is no other up-to-date copy of the data, it will kill processes to prevent any data corruptions from propagating.</p>
<p>The file has one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Kill all processes that have the corrupted-and-not-reloadable page mapped as soon as the corruption is detected. Note that this is not supported for a few types of pages, such as kernel internally allocated data or the swap cache, but works for the majority of user pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Unmap the corrupted page from all processes and kill a process only if it tries to access the page.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The kill is performed using a <strong>SIGBUS</strong> signal with <em>si_code</em> set to <strong>BUS_MCEERR_AO</strong>. Processes can handle this if they want to; see <strong>sigaction</strong>(2) for more details.</p>
<p>This feature is active only on architectures/platforms with advanced machine check handling and depends on the hardware capabilities.</p>

This is helpful to determine why the OOM-killer was invoked and to identify the rogue task that caused it.</p>
<p>If this contains the value zero, this information is suppressed. On very large systems with thousands of tasks, it may not be feasible to dump the memory state information for each one. Such systems should not be forced to incur a performance penalty in OOM situations when the information may not be desired.</p>

<dt><em>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_kbytes</em> (since Linux 3.14)</dt>
<dd><p>This writable file provides an alternative to <em>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio</em> for controlling the <em>CommitLimit</em> when <em>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</em> has the value 2. It allows the amount of memory overcommitting to be specified as an absolute value (in kB), rather than as a percentage, as is done with <em>overcommit_ratio</em>. This allows for finer-grained control of <em>CommitLimit</em> on systems with extremely large memory sizes.</p>
<p>Only one of <em>overcommit_kbytes</em> or <em>overcommit_ratio</em> can have an effect: if <em>overcommit_kbytes</em> has a nonzero value, then it is used to calculate <em>CommitLimit</em>, otherwise <em>overcommit_ratio</em> is used. Writing a value to either of these files causes the value in the other file to be set to zero.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</em></dt>
<dd><p>This file contains the kernel virtual memory accounting mode. Values are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0: heuristic overcommit (this is the default)<br />
1: always overcommit, never check<br />
2: always check, never overcommit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In mode 0, calls of <strong>mmap</strong>(2) with <strong>MAP_NORESERVE</strong> are not checked, and the default check is very weak, leading to the risk of getting a process "OOM-killed".</p>
<p>In mode 1, the kernel pretends there is always enough memory, until memory actually runs out. One use case for this mode is scientific computing applications that employ large sparse arrays. In Linux kernel versions before 2.6.0, any nonzero value implies mode 1.</p>
<p>In mode 2 (available since Linux 2.6), the total virtual address space that can be allocated (<em>CommitLimit</em> in <em>/proc/meminfo</em>) is calculated as</p>
<p>CommitLimit = (total_RAM - total_huge_TLB) * overcommit_ratio / 100 + total_swap</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>total_RAM</em> is the total amount of RAM on the system;</p></li>
<li><p><em>total_huge_TLB</em> is the amount of memory set aside for huge pages;</p></li>
<li><p><em>overcommit_ratio</em> is the value in <em>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio</em>; and</p></li>
<li><p><em>total_swap</em> is the amount of swap space.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, on a system with 16 GB of physical RAM, 16 GB of swap, no space dedicated to huge pages, and an <em>overcommit_ratio</em> of 50, this formula yields a <em>CommitLimit</em> of 24 GB.</p>
<p>Since Linux 3.14, if the value in <em>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_kbytes</em> is nonzero, then <em>CommitLimit</em> is instead calculated as:</p>
<p>CommitLimit = overcommit_kbytes + total_swap</p>

<dt><em>/proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom</em> (since Linux 2.6.18)</dt>
<dd><p>This enables or disables a kernel panic in an out-of-memory situation.</p>
<p>If this file is set to the value 0, the kernel's OOM-killer will kill some rogue process. Usually, the OOM-killer is able to kill a rogue process and the system will survive.</p>
<p>If this file is set to the value 1, then the kernel normally panics when out-of-memory happens. However, if a process limits allocations to certain nodes using memory policies (<strong>mbind</strong>(2) <strong>MPOL_BIND</strong>) or cpusets (<strong>cpuset</strong>(7)) and those nodes reach memory exhaustion status, one process may be killed by the OOM-killer. No panic occurs in this case: because other nodes' memory may be free, this means the system as a whole may not have reached an out-of-memory situation yet.</p>
<p>If this file is set to the value 2, the kernel always panics when an out-of-memory condition occurs.</p>

<p>The default value in this file is the minimum of [3% of free pages, 128MiB] expressed as KiB.</p>
<p>If the value in this file is set to zero, then a user will be allowed to allocate all free memory with a single process (minus the amount reserved by <em>/proc/sys/vm/admin_reserve_kbytes</em>). Any subsequent attempts to execute a command will result in "fork: Cannot allocate memory".</p>

<p>If enabled in the kernel (<strong>CONFIG_TIMER_STATS</strong>), but not used, it has almost zero run-time overhead and a relatively small data-structure overhead. Even if collection is enabled at run time, overhead is low: all the locking is per-CPU and lookup is hashed.</p>
<p>The <em>/proc/timer_stats</em> file is used both to control sampling facility and to read out the sampled information.</p>
<p>The <em>timer_stats</em> functionality is inactive on bootup. A sampling period can be started using the following command:</p>

<p>While sampling is enabled, each readout from <em>/proc/timer_stats</em> will see newly updated statistics. Once sampling is disabled, the sampled information is kept until a new sample period is started. This allows multiple readouts.</p>

<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Many files contain strings (e.g., the environment and command line) that are in the internal format, with subfields terminated by null bytes ('\0'). When inspecting such files, you may find that the results are more readable if you use a command of the following form to display them:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat file | tr &#39;\000&#39; &#39;\n&#39;</code></pre>
<p>This manual page is incomplete, possibly inaccurate, and is the kind of thing that needs to be updated very often.</p>
