<p>Although</p>
<p>can do everything from the command line, there are cases where it's just easier to do it once in a configuration file. Most of the options found in</p>
<p>can be used here. The first word on the line is the option and the rest of the line is the value. Leading and trailing whitespace for the option and value are trimmed. You can escape characters in the value using the \ character. Comments can be prefixed with the # character. String values should be quoted with the " character.</p>
<p>Here's a list of available options:</p>
<p>When discovering interfaces, the interface name must match</p>
<p>which is a space or comma separated list of patterns passed to</p>
<p>If the same interface is matched in</p>
<p>then it is still denied.</p>

<p>will arping each address in order before attempting DHCP. If an address is found, we will select the replying hardware address as the profile, otherwise the IP address. Example:</p>
<p>Authenticate DHCP messages. See the Supported Authentication Protocols section. If</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>snd_secretid/rcv_secretid so you can send and receive different tokens.</p>
<p>Define a shared key for use in authentication.</p>
<p>can be "" to for use with the</p>
<p>protocol.</p>
<p>is the date the token expires and should be formatted "yyy-mm-dd HH:MM". You can use the keyword</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>which means the token never expires. For the token protocol,</p>
<p>needs to be 0 and</p>
<p>needs to be "". If</p>
<p>has the error</p>
<p>then it means that</p>
<p>could not find the correct authentication token in your configuration.</p>
<p>Fork to the background immediately. This is useful for startup scripts which don't disable link messages for carrier status.</p>
<p>Ignores all packets from</p>

<p>is set.</p>
<p>Be a BOOTP client. Basically, this just doesn't send a DHCP Message Type option and will only interact with a BOOTP server. All other DHCP options still work.</p>
<p>Instructs the DHCP server to broadcast replies back to the client. Normally this is only set for non-Ethernet interfaces, such as FireWire and InfiniBand. In most cases,</p>
<p>will set this automatically.</p>
<p>Sets the group ownership of</p>
<p>so that users other than root can connect to</p>
<p>Echo debug messages to the stderr and syslog.</p>
<p>Load the</p>
<p>management module.</p>
<p>will load the first one found to work, if any.</p>
<p>Push</p>
<p>to the environment for use in</p>
<p>For example, you can force the hostname hook to always set the hostname with</p>
<p>Or set which driver</p>
<p>should use with</p>
<p>If the hostname is set, it will be will set to the FQDN if possible as per RFC 4702, section 3.1. If the FQDN option is missing,</p>
<p>will still try and set a FQDN from the hostname and domain options for consistency. To override this, set</p>
<p>A value of</p>
<p>means just what the server says, don't manipulate it. This could lead to an inconsistent hostname on a DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 network where the DHCPv4 hostname is short and the DHCPv6 has an FQDN. DHCPv6 has no hostname option.</p>
<p>Send the</p>
<p>If the string is of the format 01:02:03 then it is encoded as hex. For interfaces whose hardware address is longer than 8 bytes, or if the</p>
<p>is an empty string then</p>
<p>sends a default</p>
<p>of the hardware family and the hardware address.</p>
<p>Use a DHCP Unique Identifier. If a system UUID is available, that will be used to create a DUID-UUID, otheriwse if persistent storage is available then a DUID-LLT (link local address + time) is generated, otherwise DUID-LL is generated (link local address). This, plus the IAID will be used as the</p>
<p>The DUID generated will be held in</p>
<p>and should not be copied to other hosts. This file also takes precedence over the above rules.</p>
<p>Set the Interface Association Identifier to</p>
<p>This option must be used in an</p>
<p>block. This defaults to the VLANID (prefixed with 0xff) for the interface if set, otherwise the last 4 bytes of the hardware address assigned to the interface. Each instance of this should be unique within the scope of the client and</p>
<p>warns if a conflict is detected. If there is a conflict, it is only a problem if the conflicted IAIDs are used on the same network.</p>
<p>Enable DHCP on the interface, on by default.</p>
<p>Enable DHCPv6 on the interface, on by default.</p>
<p>Enable IPv4 on the interface, on by default.</p>
<p>Enable IPv6 on the interface, on by default.</p>
<p>Request the</p>
<p>in the DHCP DISCOVER message. There is no guarantee this is the address the DHCP server will actually give. If no</p>
<p>is given then the first address currently assigned to the</p>
<p>is used.</p>
<p>Behaves like</p>
<p>as above, but sends a DHCP INFORM instead of DISCOVER/REQUEST. This does not get a lease as such, just notifies the DHCP server of the</p>
<p>in use. You should also include the optional</p>
<p>network number in case the address is not already configured on the interface.</p>
<p>remains running and pretends it has an infinite lease.</p>
<p>will not de-configure the interface when it exits. If</p>
<p>fails to contact a DHCP server then it returns a failure instead of falling back on IPv4LL.</p>
<p>Performs a DHCPv6 Information Request. No address is requested or specified, but all other DHCPv6 options are allowed. This is normally performed automatically when an IPv6 Router Advertisement indicates that the client should perform this operation. This option is only needed when</p>
<p>is not processing IPv6 RA messages and the need for a DHCPv6 Information Request exists.</p>
<p>normally de-configures the interface and configuration when it exits. Sometimes, this isn't desirable if, for example, you have root mounted over NFS or SSH clients connect to this host and they need to be notified of the host shutting down. You can use this option to stop this from happening.</p>
<p>Fall back to using this profile if DHCP fails. This allows you to configure a static profile instead of using ZeroConf.</p>
<p>Sends the hostname</p>
<p>to the DHCP server so it can be registered in DNS. If</p>
<p>is an empty string then the current system hostname is sent. If</p>
<p>is a FQDN (i.e., contains a .) then it will be encoded as such.</p>
<p>Sends the short hostname to the DHCP server instead of the FQDN. This is useful because DHCP servers will not register the FQDN in their DNS if the domain part does not match theirs.</p>
<p>Also, see the</p>
<p>option above to control how the hostname is set on the host.</p>
<p>Request a DHCPv6 Normal Address for</p>
<p>defaults to the</p>
<p>option as described above. You can request more than one ia_na by specifying a unique</p>
<p>for each one.</p>
<p>Request a DHCPv6 Temporary Address for</p>
<p>You can request more than one ia_ta by specifying a unique</p>
<p>for each one.</p>
<p>Request a DHCPv6 Delegated Prefix for</p>
<p>This option must be used in an</p>
<p>block. Unless a</p>
<p>of 0 is assigned with the same resultant prefix length as the delegation, a reject route is installed for the Delegated Prefix to stop unallocated addresses being resolved upstream. If no</p>
<p>is given then we will assign a prefix to every other interface with a</p>
<p>equivalent to the interface index assigned by the OS. Otherwise addresses are only assigned for each</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Each assigned address will have a</p>
<p>defaulting to 1. If the</p>
<p>is 0 then a SLAAC address is assigned. You cannot assign a prefix to the requesting interface unless the DHCPv6 server supports the</p>
<p>Prefix Exclude Option.</p>
<p>has to be running for all the interfaces it is delegating to. A default</p>
<p>of 64 is assumed, unless the maximum</p>
<p>does not fit. In this case</p>
<p>is increased to the highest multiple of 8 that can accommodate the</p>
<p>is an integer which must be unique inside the</p>
<p>and is added to the prefix which must fit inside</p>
<p>less the length of the delegated prefix. You can specify multiple</p>
<p>per</p>
<p>space separated. IPv6RS should be disabled globally when requesting a Prefix Delegation.</p>
<p>In the following example eth0 is the externally facing interface to be configured for both IPv4 and IPv6. The DHCPv4 server will provide us with an IPv4 address and a default route. The DHCPv6 server is going to provide us with an IPv6 address, a default route and a /64 subnet to be delegated to the internal interface. The eth1 interface will be automatically configured for IPv6 using the first address (::1) from the delegated prefix. A second prefix is requested and assigned to two other interfaces.</p>
<p>can be used with an empty configuration file on eth1, eth2 and eth3, to provide automatic IPv6 address configuration for the internal network.</p>
<p>noipv6rs # disable routing solicitation denyinterfaces eth2 # Don't touch eth2 at all interface eth0 ipv6rs # enable routing solicitation for eth0 ia_na 1 # request an IPv6 address ia_pd 2 eth1/0 # request a PD and assign it to eth1 ia_pd 3 eth2/1 eth3/2 # req a PD and assign it to eth2 and eth3</p>
<p>Only configure IPv4.</p>
<p>Only configure IPv6.</p>
<p>will not ask the DHCP server to update DNS.</p>
<p>just asks the DHCP server to update the PTR record of the host in DNS, whereas</p>
<p>also updates the A record.</p>
<p>will disable the FQDN option. The default is</p>
<p>itself never does any DNS updates.</p>
<p>encodes the FQDN hostname as specified in</p>
<p>Subsequent options are only parsed for this</p>
<p>Generate SLAAC addresses for each Prefix advertised by an IPv6 Router Advertisement message with the Auto flag set. On by default.</p>
<p>Disables the above option.</p>
<p>By default, when</p>
<p>receives an IPv6 Router Advertisement,</p>
<p>will only fork to the background if the RA contains at least one unexpired RDNSS option and a valid prefix or no DHCPv6 instruction. Set this option so to make</p>
<p>always fork on an RA.</p>
<p>Enables IPv6 Router Advertisement solicitation. This is on by default, but is documented here in the case where it is disabled globally but needs to be enabled for one interface.</p>
<p>Request a leasetime of</p>
<p>Override the size of the link receive buffer from the kernel default. While</p>
<p>will recover from link buffer overflows, this may not be desirable on heavily loaded systems.</p>
<p>Writes to the specified</p>
<p>rather than</p>

<p>receives the</p>
<p>signal.</p>
<p>Metrics are used to prefer an interface over another one, lowest wins.</p>
<p>will supply a default metric of 200 +</p>
<p>An extra 100 will be added for wireless interfaces.</p>
<p>Specifies the URL for a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD). The description is used by upstream network devices to instantiate any desired access lists. See draft-ietf-opsawg-mud for more information.</p>
<p>Any pre-existing IPv4 addresses will be removed from the interface when adding a new IPv4 address.</p>
<p>Don't send any ARP requests. This also disables IPv4LL.</p>
<p>Don't require authentication even though we requested it. Also allows FORCERENEW and RECONFIGURE messages without authentication.</p>
<p>Don't delay for an initial randomised time when starting protocols.</p>
<p>Don't load</p>
<p>management modules.</p>
<p>Don't start DHCP or listen to DHCP messages. This is only useful when allowing IPv4LL.</p>
<p>Don't start DHCPv6 or listen to DHCPv6 messages. Normally DHCPv6 is started by an IPv6 Router Advertisement instruction or configuration.</p>
<p>Don't install any default routes.</p>
<p>Install a default route if available (default).</p>
<p>Don't run this hook script. Matches full name, or prefixed with 2 numbers optionally ending with</p>
<p>So to stop</p>
<p>from touching your DNS settings or starting wpa_supplicant you would do:-</p>
<p>Don't attempt to configure an IPv4 address.</p>
<p>Don't attempt to obtain an IPv4LL address if we failed to get one via DHCP. See</p>
<p>Don't solicit or accept IPv6 Router Advertisements and DHCPv6.</p>
<p>Don't solicit or accept IPv6 Router Advertisements.</p>
<p>Don't receive link messages about carrier status. You should only set this for buggy interface drivers.</p>
<p>Don't bring the interface up when in master mode. If</p>
<p>cannot determine the carrier state,</p>
<p>will enter a tight polling loop until the interface is marked up and running or a valid carrier state is reported.</p>
<p>Requests the</p>
<p>from the server. It can be a variable to be used in</p>
<p>or the numerical value. You can specify more</p>
<p>separated by commas, spaces or more</p>
<p>lines. Prepend dhcp6_ to</p>
<p>to request a DHCPv6 option. If no DHCPv6 options are configured, then DHCPv4 options are mapped to equivalent DHCPv6 options.</p>
<p>Prepend nd_ to</p>
<p>to handle ND options, but this only works for the</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>options.</p>
<p>To see a list of options you can use, call</p>
<p>with the</p>
<p>argument.</p>
<p>Remove the option from the message before it's processed.</p>
<p>Requires the</p>
<p>to be present in all messages, otherwise the message is ignored. To enforce that</p>
<p>only responds to DHCP servers and not BOOTP servers, you can</p>
<p>This isn't an exact science though because a BOOTP server can send DHCP-like options.</p>
<p>Reject a message that contains the</p>
<p>This is useful when you cannot use</p>
<p>to select / de-select BOOTP messages.</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>detects an address added to a point to point interface (PPP, TUN, etc) then it will set the listed DHCP options to the destination address of the interface.</p>
<p>Subsequent options are only parsed for this profile</p>
<p>Suppress any dhcpcd output to the console, except for errors.</p>
<p>Allow</p>
<p>seconds before moving to the DISCOVER phase if we have an old lease to use and moving from DISCOVER to IPv4LL if no reply. The default is 5 seconds. A setting of 0 seconds causes</p>
<p>to skip the REBOOT phase and go straight into DISCOVER. This is desirable for mobile users because if you change from network A to network B and they use the same subnet and the address from network A isn't in use on network B, then the DHCP server will remain silent even if authoritative which means</p>
<p>will timeout before moving back to the DISCOVER phase.</p>
<p>will release the lease prior to stopping the interface.</p>
<p>Use</p>
<p>instead of the default</p>
<p>Subsequent options are only parsed for this wireless</p>
<p>Selects the interface identifier used for SLAAC generated IPv6 addresses. If</p>
<p>is used, an RFC 7217 address is generated.</p>
<p>Configures a static</p>
<p>If you set</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>will not attempt to obtain a lease and will just use the value for the address with an infinite lease time. If you set</p>
<p>will continue auto-configuration as normal.</p>
<p>Here is an example which configures two static address, overriding the default IPv4 broadcast address, an IPv4 router, DNS and disables IPv6 auto-configuration. You could also use the</p>
<p>command here if you wished to obtain more information via DHCPv6. For IPv4, you should use the</p>
<p>option instead of setting a static address.</p>
<p>Here is an example for PPP which gives the destination a default route. It uses the special</p>
<p>keyword to insert the destination address into the value.</p>
<p>Time out after</p>
<p>instead of the default 30. A setting of 0</p>
<p>causes</p>
<p>to wait forever to get a lease. If</p>
<p>is working on a single interface then</p>
<p>will exit when a timeout occurs, otherwise</p>
<p>will fork into the background. If using IPv4LL then</p>
<p>start the IPv4LL process after the timeout and then wait a little longer before really timing out.</p>
<p>Tag the DHCPv4 messages with the userclass. You can specify more than one.</p>
<p>Add an encapsulated vendor option.</p>
<p>should be between 1 and 254 inclusive. To add a raw vendor string, omit</p>
<p>but keep the comma. Examples.</p>
<p>Set the vendor option 01 with an IP address.</p>
<p>Set the vendor option 02 with a hex code.</p>
<p>Set the vendor option 03 with an IP address as a string.</p>
<p>Set un-encapsulated vendor option to hello world.</p>
<p>Set the DHCP Vendor Class. DHCPv6 has its own option as shown below. The default is dhcpcd-&lt;version&gt;:&lt;os&gt;:&lt;machine&gt;:&lt;platform&gt;. For example</p>
<p>If not set then none is sent. Some badly configured DHCP servers reject unknown vendorclassids. To work around it, try and impersonate Windows by using the MSFT vendorclassid.</p>
<p>Add the DHCPv6 Vendor Indetifying Vendor Class with the IANA assigned Enterprise Number</p>
<p>with the</p>
<p>This option can be set more than once to add more data, but the behaviour, as per RFC 3925 is undefined if the Enterprise Number differs.</p>
<p>Wait for an address to be assigned before forking to the background. 4 means wait for an IPv4 address to be assigned. 6 means wait for an IPv6 address to be assigned. If no argument is given,</p>
<p>will wait for any address protocol to be assigned. It is possible to wait for more than one address protocol and</p>
<p>will only fork to the background when all waiting conditions are satisfied.</p>
<p>Use the last four bytes of the hardware address as the DHCP xid instead of a randomly generated number.</p>
<p>DHCP, ND and DHCPv6 allow for the use of custom options, and RFC 3925 vendor options for DHCP can also be supplied. Each option needs to be started with the</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>directive. This can optionally be followed by both</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>options. Both can be specified more than once and</p>

<p>This option is optional. Only makes sense for embedded options like the client FQDN option, where the FQDN string itself is optional.</p>
<p>The option can appear more than once and will be indexed.</p>
<p>The option data is split into a space separated array, each element being the same type.</p>
<p>The type directly affects the length of data consumed inside the option. Any remaining data is normally discarded. Lengths can be specified for string and binhex types, but this is generally with other data embedded afterwards in the same option.</p>
<p>An IPv4 address, 4 bytes.</p>
<p>An IPv6 address, 16 bytes.</p>
<p>A NVT ASCII string of printable characters.</p>
<p>A byte.</p>
<p>A byte represented as a string of flags, most significant bit first. For example, using ABCDEFGH then A would equal 10000000, B 01000000, C 00100000, etc. If the bit is not set, the flag is not printed. A flag of 0 is not printed even if the bit position is set. This is to allow reservation of the first bits while assigning the last bits.</p>
