<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>utmp, wtmp - login records</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>#include &lt;utmp.h&gt;</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <em>utmp</em> file allows one to discover information about who is currently using the system. There may be more users currently using the system, because not all programs use utmp logging.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> <em>utmp</em> must not be writable by the user class "other", because many system programs (foolishly) depend on its integrity. You risk faked system logfiles and modifications of system files if you leave <em>utmp</em> writable to any user other than the owner and group owner of the file.</p>
<p>The file is a sequence of <em>utmp</em> structures, declared as follows in <em>&lt;utmp.h&gt;</em> (note that this is only one of several definitions around; details depend on the version of libc):</p>

<p>This structure gives the name of the special file associated with the user's terminal, the user's login name, and the time of login in the form of <strong>time</strong>(2). String fields are terminated by a null byte ('\0') if they are shorter than the size of the field.</p>
<p>The first entries ever created result from <strong>init</strong>(1) processing <strong>inittab</strong>(5). Before an entry is processed, though, <strong>init</strong>(1) cleans up utmp by setting <em>ut_type</em> to <strong>DEAD_PROCESS</strong>, clearing <em>ut_user</em>, <em>ut_host</em>, and <em>ut_time</em> with null bytes for each record which <em>ut_type</em> is not <strong>DEAD_PROCESS</strong> or <strong>RUN_LVL</strong> and where no process with PID <em>ut_pid</em> exists. If no empty record with the needed <em>ut_id</em> can be found, <strong>init</strong>(1) creates a new one. It sets <em>ut_id</em> from the inittab, <em>ut_pid</em> and <em>ut_time</em> to the current values, and <em>ut_type</em> to <strong>INIT_PROCESS</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>mingetty</strong>(8) (or <strong>agetty</strong>(8)) locates the entry by the PID, changes <em>ut_type</em> to <strong>LOGIN_PROCESS</strong>, changes <em>ut_time</em>, sets <em>ut_line</em>, and waits for connection to be established. <strong>login</strong>(1), after a user has been authenticated, changes <em>ut_type</em> to <strong>USER_PROCESS</strong>, changes <em>ut_time</em>, and sets <em>ut_host</em> and <em>ut_addr</em>. Depending on <strong>mingetty</strong>(8) (or <strong>agetty</strong>(8)) and <strong>login</strong>(1), records may be located by <em>ut_line</em> instead of the preferable <em>ut_pid</em>.</p>
<p>When <strong>init</strong>(1) finds that a process has exited, it locates its utmp entry by <em>ut_pid</em>, sets <em>ut_type</em> to <strong>DEAD_PROCESS</strong>, and clears <em>ut_user</em>, <em>ut_host</em>, and <em>ut_time</em> with null bytes.</p>
<p><strong>xterm</strong>(1) and other terminal emulators directly create a <strong>USER_PROCESS</strong> record and generate the <em>ut_id</em> by using the string that suffix part of the terminal name (the characters following <em>/dev/[pt]ty</em>). If they find a <strong>DEAD_PROCESS</strong> for this ID, they recycle it, otherwise they create a new entry. If they can, they will mark it as <strong>DEAD_PROCESS</strong> on exiting and it is advised that they null <em>ut_line</em>, <em>ut_time</em>, <em>ut_user</em>, and <em>ut_host</em> as well.</p>
<p><strong>telnetd</strong>(8) sets up a <strong>LOGIN_PROCESS</strong> entry and leaves the rest to <strong>login</strong>(1) as usual. After the telnet session ends, <strong>telnetd</strong>(8) cleans up utmp in the described way.</p>
<p>The <em>wtmp</em> file records all logins and logouts. Its format is exactly like <em>utmp</em> except that a null username indicates a logout on the associated terminal. Furthermore, the terminal name <strong>~</strong> with username <strong>shutdown</strong> or <strong>reboot</strong> indicates a system shutdown or reboot and the pair of terminal names <strong>|</strong>/<strong>}</strong> logs the old/new system time when <strong>date</strong>(1) changes it. <em>wtmp</em> is maintained by <strong>login</strong>(1), <strong>init</strong>(1), and some versions of <strong>getty</strong>(8) (e.g., <strong>mingetty</strong>(8) or <strong>agetty</strong>(8)). None of these programs creates the file, so if it is removed, record-keeping is turned off.</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<p><em>/var/run/utmp</em><br />
<em>/var/log/wtmp</em></p>
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>POSIX.1 does not specify a <em>utmp</em> structure, but rather one named <em>utmpx</em>, with specifications for the fields <em>ut_type</em>, <em>ut_pid</em>, <em>ut_line</em>, <em>ut_id</em>, <em>ut_user</em>, and <em>ut_tv</em>. POSIX.1 does not specify the lengths of the <em>ut_line</em> and <em>ut_user</em> fields.</p>
<p>Linux defines the <em>utmpx</em> structure to be the same as the <em>utmp</em> structure.</p>
<h2>Comparison with historical systems</h2>
<p>Linux utmp entries conform neither to v7/BSD nor to System V; they are a mix of the two.</p>
<p>v7/BSD has fewer fields; most importantly it lacks <em>ut_type</em>, which causes native v7/BSD-like programs to display (for example) dead or login entries. Further, there is no configuration file which allocates slots to sessions. BSD does so because it lacks <em>ut_id</em> fields.</p>
<p>In Linux (as in System V), the <em>ut_id</em> field of a record will never change once it has been set, which reserves that slot without needing a configuration file. Clearing <em>ut_id</em> may result in race conditions leading to corrupted utmp entries and potential security holes. Clearing the abovementioned fields by filling them with null bytes is not required by System V semantics, but makes it possible to run many programs which assume BSD semantics and which do not modify utmp. Linux uses the BSD conventions for line contents, as documented above.</p>
<p>System V has no <em>ut_host</em> or <em>ut_addr_v6</em> fields.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Unlike various other systems, where utmp logging can be disabled by removing the file, utmp must always exist on Linux. If you want to disable <strong>who</strong>(1), then do not make utmp world readable.</p>
<p>The file format is machine-dependent, so it is recommended that it be processed only on the machine architecture where it was created.</p>
<p>Note that on <em>biarch</em> platforms, that is, systems which can run both 32-bit and 64-bit applications (x86-64, ppc64, s390x, etc.), <em>ut_tv</em> is the same size in 32-bit mode as in 64-bit mode. The same goes for <em>ut_session</em> and <em>ut_time</em> if they are present. This allows data files and shared memory to be shared between 32-bit and 64-bit applications. This is achieved by changing the type of <em>ut_session</em> to <em>int32_t</em>, and that of <em>ut_tv</em> to a struct with two <em>int32_t</em> fields <em>tv_sec</em> and <em>tv_usec</em>. Since <em>ut_tv</em> may not be the same as <em>struct timeval</em>, then instead of the call:</p>
<pre><code>gettimeofday((struct timeval *) &amp;ut.ut_tv, NULL);</code></pre>
<p>the following method of setting this field is recommended:</p>
<pre><code>struct utmp ut;
struct timeval tv;

gettimeofday(&amp;tv, NULL);
ut.ut_tv.tv_sec = tv.tv_sec;
ut.ut_tv.tv_usec = tv.tv_usec;</code></pre>
