<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>cupsd-logs - cupsd log files (access_log, error_log, and page_log)</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>cupsd</strong>(8) normally maintains three log files: <em>access_log</em> to track requests that are submitted to the scheduler, <em>error_log</em> to track progress and errors, and <em>page_log</em> to track pages that are printed. Configuration directives in <strong>cupsd.conf</strong>(5) and <strong>cups-files.conf</strong>(5) control what information is logged and where it is stored.</p>
<h2>ACCESS LOG FILE FORMAT</h2>
<p>The <em>access_log</em> file lists each HTTP resource that is accessed by a web browser or client. Each line is in an extended version of the so-called "Common Log Format" used by many web servers and web reporting tools:</p>
<pre><code>
    host group user date-time &quot;method resource version&quot; status bytes
      ipp-operation ipp-status
</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>
    10.0.1.2 - - [01/Dec/2005:21:50:28 +0000] &quot;POST / HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 317
      CUPS-Get-Printers successful-ok-ignored-or-substituted-attributes
    localhost - - [01/Dec/2005:21:50:32 +0000] &quot;GET /admin HTTP/1.1&quot;
      200 0 - -
    localhost - - [01/Dec/2005:21:50:32 +0000] &quot;POST / HTTP/1.1&quot;
      200 157 CUPS-Get-Printers
      successful-ok-ignored-or-substituted-attributes
    localhost - - [01/Dec/2005:21:50:32 +0000] &quot;POST / HTTP/1.1&quot;
      200 1411 CUPS-Get-Devices -
    localhost - - [01/Dec/2005:21:50:32 +0000] &quot;GET /admin HTTP/1.1&quot;
      200 6667 - -
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>host</em> field will normally only be an IP address unless you have enabled the HostNameLookups directive in the <em>cupsd.conf</em> file or if the IP address corresponds to your local machine.</p>
<p>The <em>group</em> field always contains "-".</p>
<p>The <em>user</em> field is the authenticated username of the requesting user. If no username and password is supplied for the request then this field contains "-".</p>
<p>The <em>date-time</em> field is the date and time of the request in local time and is in the format "[DD/MON/YYYY:HH:MM:SS +ZZZZ]".</p>
<p>The <em>method</em> field is the HTTP method used: "GET", "HEAD", "OPTIONS", "POST", or "PUT". "GET" requests are used to get files from the server, both for the web interface and to get configuration and log files. "HEAD" requests are used to get information about a resource prior to a "GET". "OPTIONS" requests are used to upgrade connections to TLS encryption. "POST" requests are used for web interface forms and IPP requests. "PUT" requests are used to upload configuration files.</p>
<p>The <em>resource</em> field is the filename of the requested resource.</p>
<p>The <em>version</em> field is the HTTP specification version used by the client. For CUPS clients this will always be "HTTP/1.1".</p>
<p>The <em>status</em> field contains the HTTP result status of the request, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>200</dt>
<dd><p>Successful operation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>201</dt>
<dd><p>File created/modified successfully.</p>
</dd>
<dt>304</dt>
<dd><p>The requested file has not changed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>400</dt>
<dd><p>Bad HTTP request; typically this means that you have a malicious program trying to access your server.</p>
</dd>
<dt>401</dt>
<dd><p>Unauthorized, authentication (username + password) is required.</p>
</dd>
<dt>403</dt>
<dd><p>Access is forbidden; typically this means that a client tried to access a file or resource they do not have permission to access.</p>
</dd>
<dt>404</dt>
<dd><p>The file or resource does not exist.</p>
</dd>
<dt>405</dt>
<dd><p>URL access method is not allowed; typically this means you have a web browser using your server as a proxy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>413</dt>
<dd><p>Request too large; typically this means that a client tried to print a file larger than the MaxRequestSize allows.</p>
</dd>
<dt>426</dt>
<dd><p>Upgrading to TLS-encrypted connection.</p>
</dd>
<dt>500</dt>
<dd><p>Server error; typically this happens when the server is unable to open/create a file - consult the error_log file for details.</p>
</dd>
<dt>501</dt>
<dd><p>The client requested encryption but encryption support is not enabled/compiled in.</p>
</dd>
<dt>505</dt>
<dd><p>HTTP version number not supported; typically this means that you have a malicious program trying to access your server.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>bytes</em> field contains the number of bytes in the request. For POST requests the bytes field contains the number of bytes of non-IPP data that is received from the client.</p>
<p>The <em>ipp-operation</em> field contains either "-" for non-IPP requests or the IPP operation name for POST requests containing an IPP request.</p>
<p>The <em>ipp-status</em> field contains either "-" for non-IPP requests or the IPP status code name for POST requests containing an IPP response.</p>
<h2>ERROR LOG FILE FORMAT</h2>
<p>The <em>error_log</em> file lists messages from the scheduler - errors, warnings, etc. The LogLevel directive in the <strong>cupsd.conf</strong>(5) file controls which messages are logged:</p>
<pre><code>
    level date-time message
</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>
    I [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] Queued on &#39;DeskJet&#39; by &#39;mike&#39;.
    D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[0]=&quot;DeskJet&quot;
    D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[1]=&quot;1&quot;
    D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[2]=&quot;mike&quot;
    D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[3]=&quot;myjob&quot;
    D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[4]=&quot;1&quot;
    D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[5]=&quot;media=
      na_letter_8.5x11in sides=one-sided&quot;
    D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[6]=&quot;/var/spool/cups/
      d000001-001&quot;
    I [20/May/1999:19:21:02 +0000] [Job 2] Queued on &#39;DeskJet&#39; by &#39;mike&#39;.
    I [20/May/1999:19:22:24 +0000] [Job 2] Canceled by &#39;mike&#39;.
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>level</em> field contains the type of message:</p>
<dl>
<dt>A</dt>
<dd><p>Alert message (LogLevel alert)</p>
</dd>
<dt>C</dt>
<dd><p>Critical error message (LogLevel crit)</p>
</dd>
<dt>D</dt>
<dd><p>Debugging message (LogLevel debug)</p>
</dd>
<dt>d</dt>
<dd><p>Detailed debugging message (LogLevel debug2)</p>
</dd>
<dt>E</dt>
<dd><p>Normal error message (LogLevel error)</p>
</dd>
<dt>I</dt>
<dd><p>Informational message (LogLevel info)</p>
</dd>
<dt>N</dt>
<dd><p>Notice message (LogLevel notice)</p>
</dd>
<dt>W</dt>
<dd><p>Warning message (LogLevel warn)</p>
</dd>
<dt>X</dt>
<dd><p>Emergency error message (LogLevel emerg)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <em>date-time</em> field contains the date and time of when the page started printing. The format of this field is identical to the data-time field in the <em>access_log</em> file.</p>
<p>The <em>message</em> field contains a free-form textual message. Messages from job filters are prefixed with "[Job NNN]" where "NNN" is the job ID.</p>
<h2>PAGE LOG FILE FORMAT</h2>
<p>The <em>page_log</em> file lists the total number of pages (sheets) that are printed. By default, each line contains the following information:</p>
<pre><code>
    printer user job-id date-time total num-sheets job-billing
      job-originating-host-name job-name media sides
</code></pre>
<p>For example the entry for a two page job called "myjob" might look like:</p>
<pre><code>
    DeskJet root 1 [20/May/1999:19:21:06 +0000] total 2 acme-123
      localhost myjob na_letter_8.5x11in one-sided
</code></pre>
<p>The PageLogFormat directive in the <strong>cupsd.conf</strong>(5) file can be used to change this information.</p>
<p>The <em>printer</em> field contains the name of the printer that printed the page. If you send a job to a printer class, this field will contain the name of the printer that was assigned the job.</p>
<p>The <em>user</em> field contains the name of the user (the IPP requesting-user-name attribute) that submitted this file for printing.</p>
<p>The <em>job-id</em> field contains the job number of the page being printed.</p>
<p>The <em>date-time</em> field contains the date and time of when the page started printing. The format of this field is identical to the data-time field in the <em>access_log</em> file.</p>
<p>The <em>num-sheets</em> field provides the total number of pages (sheets) that have been printed on for the job.</p>
<p>The <em>job-billing</em> field contains a copy of the job-billing or job-account-id attributes provided with the IPP Create-Job or Print-Job requests or "-" if neither was provided.</p>
<p>The <em>job-originating-host-name</em> field contains the hostname or IP address of the client that printed the job.</p>
<p>The <em>job-name</em> field contains a copy of the job-name attribute provided with the IPP Create-Job or Print-Job requests or "-" if none was provided.</p>
<p>The <em>media</em> field contains a copy of the media or media-col/media-size attribute provided with the IPP Create-Job or Print-Job requests or "-" if none was provided.</p>
<p>The <em>sides</em> field contains a copy of the sides attribute provided with the IPP Create-Job or Print-Job requests or "-" if none was provided.</p>
