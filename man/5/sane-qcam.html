<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sane-qcam - SANE backend for Connectix QuickCam cameras</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>sane-qcam</strong> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access Connectix QuickCam cameras.</p>
<h1>DEVICE NAMES</h1>
<p>This backend expects device names of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>port</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where <em>port</em> is the I/O port address at which the device resides. This address is normally specified in hexadecimal using C syntax (e.g., 0x37b) and may be prefixed with the letter "u" (e.g., u0x37b) to force the backend to access the camera in uni-directional mode.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>The contents of the <em>qcam.conf</em> file is a list port addresses that may be connected to a Connectix QuickCam. Empty lines and everything starting from a hash mark (#) up to the end of a line are ignored. A sample configuration file is shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0x37b # /dev/lp0<br />
0x378 # /dev/lp1<br />
u0x278 # /dev/lp2 forced in uni-directional mode<br />
0x3bc # /dev/lp0 (alternate address)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general, it is safest to list only the port addresses that really correspond to a QuickCam. For example, if one of the listed addresses actually connect to a printer, then starting up this backend will cause the printer to perform a device reset (which is generally undesirable).</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt><em>/etc/sane.d/qcam.conf</em></dt>
<dd><p>The backend configuration file (see also description of <strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> below).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-qcam.a</em></dt>
<dd><p>The static library implementing this backend.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-qcam.so</em></dt>
<dd><p>The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This environment variable specifies the list of directories that may contain the configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a semi-colon (`;'). If this variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in two default directories: first, the current working directory (".") and then in /etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then the default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories. For example, setting <strong>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</strong> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories "tmp/config", ".", and "/etc/sane.d" being searched (in this order).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SANE_DEBUG_QCAM</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels reduce verbosity.</p>
</dd>

<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Support is currently limited to the color version of the QuickCam. The black-and-white camera is starting to work too, but I don't believe it works in all cases yet. Reportedly, acquiring images of certain sizes work fine, but others result in shifted images (sounds like a problem due to byte-padding).</p>
<p>The program needs root-privileges since it needs to be able to access the camera's I/O ports.</p>
