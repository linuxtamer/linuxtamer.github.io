<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>filesystems - Linux filesystem types: ext, ext2, ext3, ext4, hpfs, iso9660, JFS, minix, msdos, ncpfs nfs, ntfs, proc, Reiserfs, smb, sysv, umsdos, vfat, XFS, xiafs</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>When, as is customary, the <strong>proc</strong> filesystem is mounted on <em>/proc</em>, you can find in the file <em>/proc/filesystems</em> which filesystems your kernel currently supports; see <strong>proc</strong>(5) for more details. There is also a legacy <strong>sysfs</strong>(2) system call (whose availability is controlled by the <strong>CONFIG_SYSFS_SYSCALL</strong> kernel build configuration option since Linux 3.15) that enables enumeration of the currently available filesystem types regardless of <em>/proc</em> availability and/or sanity.</p>
<p>If you need a currently unsupported filesystem, insert the corresponding kernel module or recompile the kernel.</p>
<p>In order to use a filesystem, you have to <em>mount</em> it; see <strong>mount</strong>(2) and <strong>mount</strong>(8).</p>
<p>The following list provides a short description of the available or historically available filesystems in the Linux kernel. See the kernel documentation for a comprehensive description of all options and limitations.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>ext</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is an elaborate extension of the <strong>minix</strong> filesystem. It has been completely superseded by the second version of the extended filesystem (<strong>ext2</strong>) and has been removed from the kernel (in 2.1.21).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ext2</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is the high performance disk filesystem used by Linux for fixed disks as well as removable media. The second extended filesystem was designed as an extension of the extended filesystem (<strong>ext</strong>). See <strong>ext2</strong>(5).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ext3</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is a journaling version of the <strong>ext2</strong> filesystem. It is easy to switch back and forth between <strong>ext2</strong> and <strong>ext3</strong>. See <strong>ext3</strong>(5).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ext4</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is a set of upgrades to <strong>ext3</strong> including substantial performance and reliability enhancements, plus large increases in volume, file, and directory size limits. See <strong>ext4</strong>(5).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>hpfs</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is the High Performance Filesystem, used in OS/2. This filesystem is read-only under Linux due to the lack of available documentation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>iso9660</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is a CD-ROM filesystem type conforming to the ISO 9660 standard.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>High Sierra</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Linux supports High Sierra, the precursor to the ISO 9660 standard for CD-ROM filesystems. It is automatically recognized within the <strong>iso9660</strong> filesystem support under Linux.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Rock Ridge</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Linux also supports the System Use Sharing Protocol records specified by the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol. They are used to further describe the files in the <strong>iso9660</strong> filesystem to a UNIX host, and provide information such as long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and devices. It is automatically recognized within the <strong>iso9660</strong> filesystem support under Linux.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><strong>JFS</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is a journaling filesystem, developed by IBM, that was integrated into Linux in kernel 2.4.24.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>minix</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is the filesystem used in the Minix operating system, the first to run under Linux. It has a number of shortcomings, including a 64 MB partition size limit, short filenames, and a single timestamp. It remains useful for floppies and RAM disks.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>msdos</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is the filesystem used by DOS, Windows, and some OS/2 computers. <strong>msdos</strong> filenames can be no longer than 8 characters, followed by an optional period and 3 character extension.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ncpfs</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is a network filesystem that supports the NCP protocol, used by Novell NetWare. It was was removed from the kernel in 4.17.</p>
<p>To use <strong>ncpfs</strong>, you need special programs, which can be found at <a href="ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/ncpfs"></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>nfs</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is the network filesystem used to access disks located on remote computers.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ntfs</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is the filesystem native to Microsoft Windows NT, supporting features like ACLs, journaling, encryption, and so on.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>proc</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is a pseudo filesystem which is used as an interface to kernel data structures rather than reading and interpreting <em>/dev/kmem</em>. In particular, its files do not take disk space. See <strong>proc</strong>(5).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Reiserfs</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is a journaling filesystem, designed by Hans Reiser, that was integrated into Linux in kernel 2.4.1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>smb</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is a network filesystem that supports the SMB protocol, used by Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT, and Lan Manager. See <a href="https://www.samba.org/samba/smbfs/"></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>sysv</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is an implementation of the System V/Coherent filesystem for Linux. It implements all of Xenix FS, System V/386 FS, and Coherent FS.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>umsdos</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is an extended DOS filesystem used by Linux. It adds capability for long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and special files (devices, named pipes, etc.) under the DOS filesystem, without sacrificing compatibility with DOS.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>tmpfs</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is a filesystem whose contents reside in virtual memory. Since the files on such filesystems typically reside in RAM, file access is extremely fast. See <strong>tmpfs</strong>(5).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>vfat</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is an extended FAT filesystem used by Microsoft Windows95 and Windows NT. <strong>vfat</strong> adds the capability to use long filenames under the MSDOS filesystem.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>XFS</strong></dt>
<dd><p>is a journaling filesystem, developed by SGI, that was integrated into Linux in kernel 2.4.20.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>xiafs</strong></dt>
<dd><p>was designed and implemented to be a stable, safe filesystem by extending the Minix filesystem code. It provides the basic most requested features without undue complexity. The <strong>xiafs</strong> filesystem is no longer actively developed or maintained. It was removed from the kernel in 2.1.21.</p>
