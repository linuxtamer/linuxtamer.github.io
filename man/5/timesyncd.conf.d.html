<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>timesyncd.conf, timesyncd.conf.d - Network Time Synchronization configuration files</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf</p>
<p>/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/*.conf</p>
<p>/run/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/*.conf</p>
<p>/usr/lib/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/*.conf</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These configuration files control NTP network time synchronization. See <strong>systemd.syntax</strong>(7) for a general description of the syntax.</p>
<h1>CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE</h1>
<p>The default configuration is defined during compilation, so a configuration file is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults. By default, the configuration file in /etc/systemd/ contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator. This file can be edited to create local overrides.</p>
<p>When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install configuration snippets in /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/ or /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/. The main configuration file is read before any of the configuration directories, and has the lowest precedence; entries in a file in any configuration directory override entries in the single configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they reside. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a single value, the entry in the file with the lexicographically latest name takes precedence. For options which accept a list of values, entries are collected as they occur in files sorted lexicographically.</p>
<p>Files in /etc/ are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the files.</p>
<p>To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the configuration directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration file.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The following settings are configured in the [Time] section:</p>
<p><em>NTP=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A space-separated list of NTP server host names or IP addresses. During runtime this list is combined with any per-interface NTP servers acquired from <strong>systemd-networkd.service</strong>(8). systemd-timesyncd will contact all configured system or per-interface servers in turn until one is found that responds. When the empty string is assigned, the list of NTP servers is reset, and all assignments prior to this one will have no effect. This setting defaults to an empty list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>FallbackNTP=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A space-separated list of NTP server host names or IP addresses to be used as the fallback NTP servers. Any per-interface NTP servers obtained from <strong>systemd-networkd.service</strong>(8) take precedence over this setting, as do any servers set via <em>NTP=</em> above. This setting is hence only used if no other NTP server information is known. When the empty string is assigned, the list of NTP servers is reset, and all assignments prior to this one will have no effect. If this option is not given, a compiled-in list of NTP servers is used instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>RootDistanceMaxSec=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maximum acceptable root distance. Takes a time value (in seconds). Defaults to 5 seconds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>PollIntervalMinSec=</em>, <em>PollIntervalMaxSec=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The minimum and maximum poll intervals for NTP messages. Each setting takes a time value (in seconds). <em>PollIntervalMinSec=</em> must not be smaller than 16 seconds. <em>PollIntervalMaxSec=</em> must be larger than <em>PollIntervalMinSec=</em>. <em>PollIntervalMinSec=</em> defaults to 32 seconds, and <em>PollIntervalMaxSec=</em> defaults to 2048 seconds.</p>
