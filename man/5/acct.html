<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>acct - process accounting file</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>#include &lt;sys/acct.h&gt;</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>If the kernel is built with the process accounting option enabled (<strong>CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT</strong>), then calling <strong>acct</strong>(2) starts process accounting, for example:</p>
<p>acct("/var/log/pacct");</p>
<p>When process accounting is enabled, the kernel writes a record to the accounting file as each process on the system terminates. This record contains information about the terminated process, and is defined in <em>&lt;sys/acct.h&gt;</em> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>#define ACCT_COMM 16

typedef u_int16_t comp_t;

struct acct {
    char ac_flag;           /* Accounting flags */
    u_int16_t ac_uid;       /* Accounting user ID */
    u_int16_t ac_gid;       /* Accounting group ID */
    u_int16_t ac_tty;       /* Controlling terminal */
    u_int32_t ac_btime;     /* Process creation time
                               (seconds since the Epoch) */
    comp_t    ac_utime;     /* User CPU time */
    comp_t    ac_stime;     /* System CPU time */
    comp_t    ac_etime;     /* Elapsed time */
    comp_t    ac_mem;       /* Average memory usage (kB) */
    comp_t    ac_io;        /* Characters transferred (unused) */
    comp_t    ac_rw;        /* Blocks read or written (unused) */
    comp_t    ac_minflt;    /* Minor page faults */
    comp_t    ac_majflt;    /* Major page faults */
    comp_t    ac_swaps;     /* Number of swaps (unused) */
    u_int32_t ac_exitcode;  /* Process termination status
                               (see wait(2)) */
    char      ac_comm[ACCT_COMM+1];
                            /* Command name (basename of last
                               executed command; null-terminated) */
    char      ac_pad[X];    /* padding bytes */
};

enum {          /* Bits that may be set in ac_flag field */
    AFORK = 0x01,           /* Has executed fork, but no exec */
    ASU   = 0x02,           /* Used superuser privileges */
    ACORE = 0x08,           /* Dumped core */
    AXSIG = 0x10            /* Killed by a signal */
};</code></pre>
<p>The <em>comp_t</em> data type is a floating-point value consisting of a 3-bit, base-8 exponent, and a 13-bit mantissa. A value, <em>c</em>, of this type can be converted to a (long) integer as follows:</p>
<pre><code>    v = (c &amp; 0x1fff) &lt;&lt; (((c &gt;&gt; 13) &amp; 0x7) * 3);</code></pre>
<p>The <em>ac_utime</em>, <em>ac_stime</em>, and <em>ac_etime</em> fields measure time in "clock ticks"; divide these values by <em>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</em> to convert them to seconds.</p>
<h2>Version 3 accounting file format</h2>
<p>Since kernel 2.6.8, an optional alternative version of the accounting file can be produced if the <strong>CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT_V3</strong> option is set when building the kernel. With this option is set, the records written to the accounting file contain additional fields, and the width of <em>c_uid</em> and <em>ac_gid</em> fields is widened from 16 to 32 bits (in line with the increased size of UID and GIDs in Linux 2.4 and later). The records are defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code>struct acct_v3 {
    char      ac_flag;      /* Flags */
    char      ac_version;   /* Always set to ACCT_VERSION (3) */
    u_int16_t ac_tty;       /* Controlling terminal */
    u_int32_t ac_exitcode;  /* Process termination status */
    u_int32_t ac_uid;       /* Real user ID */
    u_int32_t ac_gid;       /* Real group ID */
    u_int32_t ac_pid;       /* Process ID */
    u_int32_t ac_ppid;      /* Parent process ID */
    u_int32_t ac_btime;     /* Process creation time */
    float     ac_etime;     /* Elapsed time */
    comp_t    ac_utime;     /* User CPU time */
    comp_t    ac_stime;     /* System time */
    comp_t    ac_mem;       /* Average memory usage (kB) */
    comp_t    ac_io;        /* Characters transferred (unused) */
    comp_t    ac_rw;        /* Blocks read or written
                               (unused) */
    comp_t    ac_minflt;    /* Minor page faults */
    comp_t    ac_majflt;    /* Major page faults */
    comp_t    ac_swaps;     /* Number of swaps (unused) */
    char      ac_comm[ACCT_COMM]; /* Command name */
};</code></pre>
<h1>VERSIONS</h1>
<p>The <em>acct_v3</em> structure is defined in glibc since version 2.6.</p>
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1>
<p>Process accounting originated on BSD. Although it is present on most systems, it is not standardized, and the details vary somewhat between systems.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Records in the accounting file are ordered by termination time of the process.</p>
<p>In kernels up to and including 2.6.9, a separate accounting record is written for each thread created using the NPTL threading library; since Linux 2.6.10, a single accounting record is written for the entire process on termination of the last thread in the process.</p>
<p>The <em>/proc/sys/kernel/acct</em> file, described in <strong>proc</strong>(5), defines settings that control the behavior of process accounting when disk space runs low.</p>
