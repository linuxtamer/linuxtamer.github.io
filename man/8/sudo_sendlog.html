<p>The path to a certificate authority bundle file, in PEM format, to use instead of the system's default certificate authority database when authenticating the log server. The default is to use the system's default certificate authority database.</p>
<p>The path to the client's certificate file in PEM format. This setting is required when the connection to the remote log server is secured with TLS.</p>
<p>Display a short help message to the standard output and exit.</p>
<p>Connect to the specified</p>

<p>option must also be specified when restarting a transfer.</p>
<p>Send a reject event for the command using the specified</p>
