<p>is a program that speaks the server side of SFTP protocol to stdout and expects client requests from stdin.</p>
<p>is not intended to be called directly, but from</p>
<p>using the</p>
<p>option.</p>
<p>Command-line flags to</p>
<p>should be specified in the</p>
<p>declaration. See</p>
<p>for more information.</p>
<p>Valid options are:</p>
<p>specifies an alternate starting directory for users. The pathname may contain the following tokens that are expanded at runtime: %% is replaced by a literal '%', %d is replaced by the home directory of the user being authenticated, and %u is replaced by the username of that user. The default is to use the user's home directory. This option is useful in conjunction with the</p>
<p>option.</p>
<p>Causes</p>
<p>to print logging information to stderr instead of syslog for debugging.</p>
<p>Specifies the facility code that is used when logging messages from</p>
<p>The possible values are: DAEMON, USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2, LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7. The default is AUTH.</p>
<p>Displays</p>
<p>usage information.</p>
<p>Specifies which messages will be logged by</p>
<p>The possible values are: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3. INFO and VERBOSE log transactions that</p>
<p>performs on behalf of the client. DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent. DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify higher levels of debugging output. The default is ERROR.</p>
<p>Specify a comma-separated list of SFTP protocol requests that are banned by the server.</p>
<p>will reply to any denied request with a failure. The</p>
<p>flag can be used to determine the supported request types. If both denied and allowed lists are specified, then the denied list is applied before the allowed list.</p>
<p>Specify a comma-separated list of SFTP protocol requests that are permitted by the server. All request types that are not on the allowed list will be logged and replied to with a failure message.</p>
<p>Care must be taken when using this feature to ensure that requests made implicitly by SFTP clients are permitted.</p>
<p>Query protocol features supported by</p>
<p>At present the only feature that may be queried is</p>
<p>which may be used to deny or allow specific requests (flags</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>respectively).</p>
<p>Places this instance of</p>
<p>into a read-only mode. Attempts to open files for writing, as well as other operations that change the state of the filesystem, will be denied.</p>
<p>Sets an explicit</p>
<p>to be applied to newly-created files and directories, instead of the user's default mask.</p>
<p>On some systems,</p>
<p>must be able to access</p>
<p>for logging to work, and use of</p>
<p>in a chroot configuration therefore requires that</p>
<p>establish a logging socket inside the chroot directory.</p>
