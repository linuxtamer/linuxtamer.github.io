<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>setpci - configure PCI devices</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>setpci</strong> [<strong>options</strong>] <strong>devices</strong> <strong>operations</strong>...</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>setpci</strong> is a utility for querying and configuring PCI devices.</p>
<p>All numbers are entered in hexadecimal notation.</p>
<p>Root privileges are necessary for almost all operations, excluding reads of the standard header of the configuration space on some operating systems. Please see <strong>lspci(8)</strong> for details on access rights.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<h2>General options</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-v</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Tells <em>setpci</em> to be verbose and display detailed information about configuration space accesses.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-f</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Tells <em>setpci</em> not to complain when there's nothing to do (when no devices are selected). This option is intended for use in widely-distributed configuration scripts where it's uncertain whether the device in question is present in the machine or not.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-D</strong></dt>
<dd><p>`Demo mode' -- don't write anything to the configuration registers. It's useful to try <strong>setpci -vD</strong> to verify that your complex sequence of <strong>setpci</strong> operations does what you think it should do.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-r</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Avoids bus scan if each operation selects a specific device (uses the <strong>-s</strong> selector with specific domain, bus, slot, and function). This is faster, but if the device does not exist, it fails instead of matching an empty set of devices.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--version</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Show <em>setpci</em> version. This option should be used stand-alone.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--help</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Show detailed help on available options. This option should be used stand-alone.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--dumpregs</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Show a list of all known PCI registers and capabilities. This option should be used stand-alone.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>PCI access options</h2>
<p>The PCI utilities use the PCI library to talk to PCI devices (see <strong>pcilib</strong>(7) for details). You can use the following options to influence its behavior:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-A &lt;method&gt;</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The library supports a variety of methods to access the PCI hardware. By default, it uses the first access method available, but you can use this option to override this decision. See <strong>-A help</strong> for a list of available methods and their descriptions.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-O &lt;param&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The behavior of the library is controlled by several named parameters. This option allows one to set the value of any of the parameters. Use <strong>-O help</strong> for a list of known parameters and their default values.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-H1</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 1. (This is a shorthand for <strong>-A intel-conf1</strong>.)</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-H2</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 2. (This is a shorthand for <strong>-A intel-conf2</strong>.)</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-G</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Increase debug level of the library.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>DEVICE SELECTION</h1>
<p>Before each sequence of operations you need to select which devices you wish that operation to affect.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-s [[[[&lt;domain&gt;]:]&lt;bus&gt;]:][&lt;slot&gt;][.[&lt;func&gt;]]</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Consider only devices in the specified domain (in case your machine has several host bridges, they can either share a common bus number space or each of them can address a PCI domain of its own; domains are numbered from 0 to ffff), bus (0 to ff), slot (0 to 1f) and function (0 to 7). Each component of the device address can be omitted or set to "*", both meaning "any value". All numbers are hexadecimal. E.g., "0:" means all devices on bus 0, "0" means all functions of device 0 on any bus, "0.3" selects third function of device 0 on all buses and ".4" matches only the fourth function of each device.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-d [&lt;vendor&gt;]:[&lt;device&gt;]</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Select devices with specified vendor and device ID. Both ID's are given in hexadecimal and may be omitted or given as "*", both meaning "any value".</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When <strong>-s</strong> and <strong>-d</strong> are combined, only devices that match both criteria are selected. When multiple options of the same kind are specified, the rightmost one overrides the others.</p>
<h1>OPERATIONS</h1>
<p>There are two kinds of operations: reads and writes. To read a register, just specify its name. Writes have the form <em>name</em>=<em>value</em>,<em>value</em>... where each <em>value</em> is either a hexadecimal number or an expression of type <em>data</em>:<em>mask</em> where both <em>data</em> and <em>mask</em> are hexadecimal numbers. In the latter case, only the bits corresponding to binary ones in the <em>mask</em> are changed (technically, this is a read-modify-write operation).</p>
<p>There are several ways how to identity a register:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tell its address in hexadecimal.</p></li>
<li><p>Spell its name. Setpci knows the names of all registers in the standard configuration headers. Use `<strong>setpci --dumpregs</strong>' to get the complete list. See PCI bus specifications for the precise meaning of these registers or consult <strong>header.h</strong> or <strong>/usr/include/pci/pci.h</strong> for a brief sketch.</p></li>
<li><p>If the register is a part of a PCI capability, you can specify the name of the capability to get the address of its first register. See the names starting with `CAP_' or `ECAP_' in the <strong>--dumpregs</strong> output.</p></li>
<li><p>If the name of the capability is not known to <strong>setpci</strong>, you can refer to it by its number in the form CAP<strong>id</strong> or ECAP<strong>id</strong>, where <strong>id</strong> is the numeric identifier of the capability in hexadecimal.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of the previous formats can be followed by <strong>+offset</strong> to add an offset (a hex number) to the address. This feature can be useful for addressing of registers living within a capability, or to modify parts of standard registers.</p></li>
<li><p>To choose how many bytes (1, 2, or 4) should be transferred, you should append a width specifier <strong>.B</strong>, <strong>.W</strong>, or <strong>.L</strong>. The width can be omitted if you are referring to a register by its name and the width of the register is well known.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, if a capability exists multiple times you can choose which one to target using <strong>@number</strong>. Indexing starts at 0.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All names of registers and width specifiers are case-insensitive.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>asks for the word-sized command register.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>is a numeric address of the same register.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>asks for a 32-bit word starting at the location of the command register, i.e., the command and status registers together.</p></li>
<li><p>specifies the upper byte of the vendor ID register (remember, PCI is little-endian).</p></li>
<li><p>corresponds to the second word of the power management capability.</p></li>
<li><p>asks for the first 32-bit word of the extended capability with ID 0x108.</p></li>
</ul>
