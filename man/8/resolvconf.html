<p>as private. This means that the name servers listed in that</p>
<p>are only used for queries against the domain/search listed in the same file. This only works when a local resolver other than libc is installed. See</p>
<p>for how to configure</p>
<p>to use a local name server and how to remove the private marking.</p>
<p>can mark an interfaces</p>
<p>as exclusive. Only the latest exclusive interface is used for processing, otherwise all are.</p>
<p>When an interface goes down, it should then call</p>

<p>with</p>
<p>arguments to deprecate the matching interfaces and</p>
<p>to activate the matching interfaces when the carrier comes up. This only affects the order in which interfaces are processed.</p>
<p>Here are some options for the above commands:-</p>
<p>Ignore non existent interfaces. Only really useful for deleting interfaces.</p>
<p>Set the metric of the interface when adding it, default of 0. Lower metrics take precedence. This affects the default order of interfaces when listed.</p>

<p>For</p>
<p>to work effectively, it has to process the resolv.confs for the interfaces in the correct order.</p>
<p>first processes interfaces from the</p>
<p>list, then interfaces without a metic and that match the</p>
<p>list, then interfaces with a metric in order and finally the rest in the operating systems lexical order. See</p>
<p>for details on these lists.</p>
<p>Here are some suggested protocol tags to use for each</p>
<p>file registered on an</p>
<p>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. Initial versions of</p>
<p>did not recommend a</p>
<p>tag be appended to the</p>
<p>name. When the protocol is absent, it is assumed to be the DHCP protocol.</p>

<p>IPv6 Router Advertisement.</p>
<p>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, version 6.</p>
<p>If a subscriber has the executable bit then it is executed otherwise it is assumed to be a shell script and sourced into the current environment in a subshell. This is done so that subscribers can remain fast, but are also not limited to the shell language.</p>
