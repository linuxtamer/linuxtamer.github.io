<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>i2c-stub-from-dump - feed i2c-stub with dump files</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>i2c-stub-from-dump</strong> <em>address</em>[,<em>address</em>,...] <em>dump-file</em> [<em>dump-file</em> ...]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>i2c-stub-from-dump is a small helper script for the i2c-stub kernel driver. It lets you setup one or more fake I2C chips on the i2c-stub bus based on dumps of the chips you want to emulate.</p>
<p>i2c-stub-from-dump requires i2cdetect and i2cset to be installed and reachable through the user's PATH. The former is used to find out the i2c-stub bus number, while the latter is used to write to the fake I2C chips.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>You have an I2C chip on system A. You would like to do some development on its driver on system B. Here are the few steps you have to follow.</p>
<p>On system A, use i2cdump to capture a dump from the chip. Assuming that the chip in question lives at address 0x4c on I2C bus 0, you would run:</p>
<p>i2cdump -y 0 0x4c b &gt; chip.dump</p>
<p>Adjust the bus number and chip address for your case. i2cdetect can help you find out their values. If the device uses word (16-bit) register access instead of the traditional byte (8-bit) access, use mode <strong>w</strong> instead of <strong>b</strong>.</p>
<p>Copy the dump file to system B.</p>
<p>On system B, run:</p>
<p>i2c-stub-from-dump 0x4c chip.dump</p>
<p>This will load the required i2c-dev and i2c-stub kernel drivers if needed, then write all the register values to the emulated I2C chip at address 0x4c. Again, adjust the address as needed.</p>
<h1>LIMITATIONS</h1>
<p>There are some limitations to the kind of devices that can be handled:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Device must not have banks (as most Winbond devices do).</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>To report bugs or send fixes, please write to the Linux I2C mailing list &lt;linux-i2c@vger.kernel.org&gt; with Cc to the current maintainer: Jean Delvare &lt;jdelvare@suse.de&gt;.</p>
