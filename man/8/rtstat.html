<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>lnstat - unified linux network statistics</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>lnstat</strong> [<em>options</em>]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This manual page documents briefly the <strong>lnstat</strong> command.</p>
<p><strong>lnstat</strong> is a generalized and more feature-complete replacement for the old rtstat program. It is commonly used to periodically print a selection of statistical values exported by the kernel. In addition to routing cache statistics, it supports any kind of statistics the linux kernel exports via a file in /proc/net/stat/.</p>
<p>Each file in /proc/net/stat/ contains a header line listing the column names. These names are used by <strong>lnstat</strong> as keys for selecting which statistics to print. For every CPU present in the system, a line follows which lists the actual values for each column of the file. <strong>lnstat</strong> sums these values up (which in fact are counters) before printing them. After each interval, only the difference to the last value is printed.</p>
<p>Files and columns may be selected by using the <strong>-f</strong> and <strong>-k</strong> parameters. By default, all columns of all files are printed.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>lnstat supports the following options.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-h, --help</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Show summary of options.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-V, --version</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Show version of program.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-c, --count &lt;count&gt;</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Print &lt;count&gt; number of intervals.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-d, --dump</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Dump list of available files/keys.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-f, --file &lt;file&gt;</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Statistics file to use, may be specified multiple times. By default all files in /proc/net/stat are scanned.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-i, --interval &lt;intv&gt;</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Set interval to 'intv' seconds.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-j, --json</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Display results in JSON format</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-k, --keys k,k,k,...</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Display only keys specified. Each key <strong>k</strong> is of the form <strong>[file:]key</strong>. If <strong>&lt;file&gt;</strong> is given, the search for the given key is limited to that file. Otherwise the first file containing the searched key is being used.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-s, --subject [0-2]</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Specify display of subject/header. '0' means no header at all, '1' prints a header only at start of the program and '2' prints a header every 20 lines.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-w, --width n,n,n,...</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Width for each field.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<dt><strong># lnstat -s 0</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Do not print a header at all.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong># lnstat -s 20</strong></dt>
