<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>pfifo_fast - three-band first in, first out queue</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>pfifo_fast is the default qdisc of each interface.</p>
<p>Whenever an interface is created, the pfifo_fast qdisc is automatically used as a queue. If another qdisc is attached, it preempts the default pfifo_fast, which automatically returns to function when an existing qdisc is detached.</p>
<p>In this sense this qdisc is magic, and unlike other qdiscs.</p>
<h1>ALGORITHM</h1>
<p>The algorithm is very similar to that of the classful <strong>tc-prio</strong>(8) qdisc. <strong>pfifo_fast</strong> is like three <strong>tc-pfifo</strong>(8) queues side by side, where packets can be enqueued in any of the three bands based on their Type of Service bits or assigned priority.</p>
<p>Not all three bands are dequeued simultaneously - as long as lower bands have traffic, higher bands are never dequeued. This can be used to prioritize interactive traffic or penalize 'lowest cost' traffic.</p>
<p>Each band can be txqueuelen packets long, as configured with <strong>ifconfig</strong>(8) or <strong>ip</strong>(8). Additional packets coming in are not enqueued but are instead dropped.</p>
<p>See <strong>tc-prio</strong>(8) for complete details on how TOS bits are translated into bands.</p>
<h1>PARAMETERS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>txqueuelen</dt>
<dd><p>The length of the three bands depends on the interface txqueuelen, as specified with <strong>ifconfig</strong>(8) or <strong>ip</strong>(8).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>Does not maintain statistics and does not show up in tc qdisc ls. This is because it is the automatic default in the absence of a configured qdisc.</p>
