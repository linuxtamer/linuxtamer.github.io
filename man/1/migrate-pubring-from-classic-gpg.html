<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>migrate-pubring-from-classic-gpg - Migrate a public keyring from "classic" to "modern" GnuPG</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>migrate-pubring-from-classic-gpg</strong> [ <strong>GPGHOMEDIR</strong> | <em>--default</em> ]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>migrate-pubring-from-classic-gpg</strong> migrates the public keyring in GnuPG home directory GPGHOMEDIR from the "classic" keyring format (pubring.gpg) to the "modern" keybox format using GnuPG versions 2.1 or 2.2 (pubring.kbx).</p>
<p>Specifying <strong>--default</strong> selects the standard GnuPG home directory (looking at $GNUPGHOME first, and falling back to ~/.gnupg if unset.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong>, <strong>--usage</strong> Output a short usage information.</p>
<h1>DIAGNOSTICS</h1>
<p>The program sends quite a bit of text (perhaps too much) to stderr.</p>
<p>During a migration, the tool backs up several pieces of data in a timestamped subdirectory of the GPGHOMEDIR.</p>
<h1>LIMITATIONS</h1>
<p>The keybox format rejects a number of OpenPGP certificates that the "classic" keyring format used to accept. These filters are defensive, since the certificates rejected are unsafe -- either cryptographically unsound, or dangerously non-performant. This means that some migrations may produce warning messages about the migration being incomplete. This is generally a good thing!</p>
<p>Known limitations:</p>
<p><strong>Flooded certificates</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some OpenPGP certificates have been flooded with bogus certifications as part of an attack on the SKS keyserver network (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dkg-openpgp-abuse-resistant-keystore-03#section-2.1).</p>
<p>The keybox format rejects import of any OpenPGP certificate larger than 5MiB. As of GnuPG 2.2.17, if gpg encounters such a flooded certificate will retry the import while stripping all third-party certifications (see "self-sigs-only" in gpg(1)).</p>
<p>The typical error message when migrating a keyring with a flooded certificate will be something like:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>error writing keyring 'pubring.kbx': Provided object is too large</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OpenPGPv3 public keys (a.k.a. PGP-2 keys)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern OpenPGP implementations use so-called "OpenPGP v4" public keys. Older versions of the public key format have serious known problems. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.5.2 for more details about and reasons for v3 key deprecation.</p>
<p>The keybox format skips v3 keys entirely during migration, and GnuPG will produce a message like:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>skipped PGP-2 keys: 1</p>
