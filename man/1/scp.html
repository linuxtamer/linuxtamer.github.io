<p>The options are as follows:</p>
<p>Copies between two remote hosts are transferred through the local host. Without this option the data is copied directly between the two remote hosts. Note that this option disables the progress meter and selects batch mode for the second host, since</p>

<p>Disable strict filename checking. By default when copying files from a remote host to a local directory</p>
<p>checks that the received filenames match those requested on the command-line to prevent the remote end from sending unexpected or unwanted files. Because of differences in how various operating systems and shells interpret filename wildcards, these checks may cause wanted files to be rejected. This option disables these checks at the expense of fully trusting that the server will not send unexpected filenames.</p>
