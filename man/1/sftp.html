<p>is a file transfer program, similar to</p>
<p>which performs all operations over an encrypted</p>
<p>transport. It may also use many features of ssh, such as public key authentication and compression.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>may be specified either as</p>
<p>or as a URI in the form</p>
<p>If the</p>
<p>includes a</p>
<p>and it is not a directory,</p>
<p>will retrieve files automatically if a non-interactive authentication method is used; otherwise it will do so after successful interactive authentication.</p>
<p>If no</p>
<p>is specified, or if the</p>
<p>is a directory,</p>
<p>will log in to the specified</p>
<p>and enter interactive command mode, changing to the remote directory if one was specified. An optional trailing slash can be used to force the</p>
<p>to be interpreted as a directory.</p>
<p>Since the destination formats use colon characters to delimit host names from path names or port numbers, IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in square brackets to avoid ambiguity.</p>
<p>The options are as follows:</p>
<p>Forces</p>
<p>to use IPv4 addresses only.</p>
<p>Forces</p>
<p>to use IPv6 addresses only.</p>
<p>Allows forwarding of</p>
<p>to the remote system. The default is not to forward an authentication agent.</p>
<p>Attempt to continue interrupted transfers rather than overwriting existing partial or complete copies of files. If the partial contents differ from those being transferred, then the resultant file is likely to be corrupt.</p>
<p>Specify the size of the buffer that</p>
<p>uses when transferring files. Larger buffers require fewer round trips at the cost of higher memory consumption. The default is 32768 bytes.</p>
<p>Batch mode reads a series of commands from an input</p>
<p>instead of</p>
<p>Since it lacks user interaction it should be used in conjunction with non-interactive authentication to obviate the need to enter a password at connection time (see</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>for details).</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>may be used to indicate standard input.</p>
<p>will abort if any of the following commands fail:</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Termination on error can be suppressed on a command by command basis by prefixing the command with a</p>
<p>character (for example,</p>
<p>Echo of the command may be suppressed by prefixing the command with a</p>
<p>character. These two prefixes may be combined in any order, for example</p>
<p>Enables compression (via ssh's</p>
<p>flag).</p>
<p>Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfers. This option is directly passed to</p>
<p>Connect directly to a local sftp server (rather than via</p>
<p>This option may be useful in debugging the client and server.</p>
<p>Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for</p>
<p>This option is directly passed to</p>
<p>Requests that files be flushed to disk immediately after transfer. When uploading files, this feature is only enabled if the server implements the "fsync@openssh.com" extension.</p>
<p>Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for public key authentication is read. This option is directly passed to</p>
<p>Connect to the target host by first making an</p>
<p>connection to the jump host described by</p>
<p>and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from there. Multiple jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters. This is a shortcut to specify a</p>
<p>configuration directive. This option is directly passed to</p>
<p>Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.</p>
<p>Disables quiet mode, e.g. to override the implicit quiet mode set by the</p>
<p>flag.</p>
<p>Can be used to pass options to</p>
<p>in the format used in</p>
<p>This is useful for specifying options for which there is no separate</p>
<p>command-line flag. For example, to specify an alternate port use:</p>
<p>For full details of the options listed below, and their possible values, see</p>
<p>Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.</p>
<p>Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the original files transferred.</p>
<p>Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as warning and diagnostic messages from</p>
<p>Specify how many requests may be outstanding at any one time. Increasing this may slightly improve file transfer speed but will increase memory usage. The default is 64 outstanding requests.</p>
<p>Recursively copy entire directories when uploading and downloading. Note that</p>
<p>does not follow symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal.</p>
<p>Name of the</p>
<p>to use for the encrypted connection. The program must understand</p>
<p>options.</p>
<p>Specifies the SSH2 subsystem or the path for an sftp server on the remote host. A path is useful when the remote</p>
<p>does not have an sftp subsystem configured.</p>
<p>Raise logging level. This option is also passed to ssh.</p>
<p>Once in interactive mode,</p>
<p>understands a set of commands similar to those of</p>
<p>Commands are case insensitive. Pathnames that contain spaces must be enclosed in quotes. Any special characters contained within pathnames that are recognized by</p>
<p>must be escaped with backslashes</p>
<p>Quit</p>

<p>must be a numeric UID.</p>
<p>Display usage information for the filesystem holding the current directory (or</p>
<p>if specified). If the</p>
<p>flag is specified, the capacity information will be displayed using "human-readable" suffixes. The</p>
<p>flag requests display of inode information in addition to capacity information. This command is only supported on servers that implement the</p>
<p>extension.</p>

<p>is specified, then</p>
<p>must specify a directory.</p>
<p>If the</p>
<p>flag is specified, then attempt to resume partial transfers of existing files. Note that resumption assumes that any partial copy of the local file matches the remote copy. If the remote file contents differ from the partial local copy then the resultant file is likely to be corrupt.</p>
<p>If the</p>
