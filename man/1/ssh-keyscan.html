<p>is a utility for gathering the public SSH host keys of a number of hosts. It was designed to aid in building and verifying</p>
<p>files, the format of which is documented in</p>
<p>provides a minimal interface suitable for use by shell and perl scripts.</p>
<p>uses non-blocking socket I/O to contact as many hosts as possible in parallel, so it is very efficient. The keys from a domain of 1,000 hosts can be collected in tens of seconds, even when some of those hosts are down or do not run</p>
<p>For scanning, one does not need login access to the machines that are being scanned, nor does the scanning process involve any encryption.</p>
<p>The options are as follows:</p>
<p>Force</p>
<p>to use IPv4 addresses only.</p>
<p>Force</p>
<p>to use IPv6 addresses only.</p>
<p>Request certificates from target hosts instead of plain keys.</p>
<p>Print keys found as SSHFP DNS records. The default is to print keys in a format usable as a</p>
<p>file.</p>
<p>Read hosts or</p>
<p>pairs from</p>
<p>one per line. If</p>
<p>is supplied instead of a filename,</p>
<p>will read from the standard input. Input is expected in the format:</p>
<p>1.2.3.4,1.2.4.4 name.my.domain,name,n.my.domain,n,1.2.3.4,1.2.4.4</p>
<p>Hash all hostnames and addresses in the output. Hashed names may be used normally by</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>but they do not reveal identifying information should the file's contents be disclosed.</p>
<p>Connect to</p>
<p>on the remote host.</p>
<p>Set the timeout for connection attempts. If</p>
<p>seconds have elapsed since a connection was initiated to a host or since the last time anything was read from that host, the connection is closed and the host in question considered unavailable. The default is 5 seconds.</p>
<p>Specify the type of the key to fetch from the scanned hosts. The possible values are</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Multiple values may be specified by separating them with commas. The default is to fetch</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>keys.</p>
<p>Verbose mode: print debugging messages about progress.</p>
<p>If an ssh_known_hosts file is constructed using</p>
<p>without verifying the keys, users will be vulnerable to</p>
<p>attacks. On the other hand, if the security model allows such a risk,</p>
<p>can help in the detection of tampered keyfiles or man in the middle attacks which have begun after the ssh_known_hosts file was created.</p>
<p>Print the RSA host key for machine</p>
<p>Find all hosts from the file</p>
<p>which have new or different keys from those in the sorted file</p>
<p>$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa,dsa,ecdsa,ed25519 -f ssh_hosts | \ sort -u - ssh_known_hosts | diff ssh_known_hosts -</p>
<p>wrote the initial version, and</p>
<p>added support for protocol version 2.</p>
