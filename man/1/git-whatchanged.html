<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>git-whatchanged - Show logs with difference each commit introduces</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>git whatchanged &lt;option&gt;...</code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Shows commit logs and diff output each commit introduces.</p>
<p>New users are encouraged to use <strong>git-log</strong>(1) instead. The <strong>whatchanged</strong> command is essentially the same as <strong>git-log</strong>(1) but defaults to show the raw format diff output and to skip merges.</p>
<p>The command is kept primarily for historical reasons; fingers of many people who learned Git long before <strong>git log</strong> was invented by reading Linux kernel mailing list are trained to type it.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p><strong>git whatchanged -p v2.6.12.. include/scsi drivers/scsi</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show as patches the commits since version <em>v2.6.12</em> that changed any file in the include/scsi or drivers/scsi subdirectories</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>git whatchanged --since="2 weeks ago" -- gitk</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file <em>gitk</em>. The "--" is necessary to avoid confusion with the <strong>branch</strong> named <em>gitk</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h1>GIT</h1>
<p>Part of the <strong>git</strong>(1) suite</p>
