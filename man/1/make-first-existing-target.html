<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>make-first-existing-target - runs make on one of several targets</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>make-first-existing-target [-c cmd] target1 [target2 ...] Ω- [make-options]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The design of <em>make</em> (1) causes difficulty when you know that a Makefile probably has one of several standardized target names, and want build machinery to run exactly one of them, propagating any errors. <em>make</em> (1) will exit 2 if a target does not exist, but an existing target may also exit 2 due to some other failure. Makefiles cannot be reliably parsed to find targets by anything less Turing-complete than make, and make itself does not provide a way to enumerate the targets in a Makefile. It may not even be possible to enumerate the targets in a Makefile without executing part of it. (Proof of this is left as an exercise for the reader.)</p>
<p>This program avoids the problems described above, by attempting to call each specified target in turn, until it observes make actually doing something for one of them.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>This can be used to specify the make command to run. Default is make.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1>
<p>The exit status is 0 if at least one target existed and was successfully run, and nonzero otherwise.</p>
