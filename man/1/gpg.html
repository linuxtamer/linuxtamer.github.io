<h1>NAME</h1>
<p><strong>gpg</strong> - OpenPGP encryption and signing tool</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>gpg</strong> [<strong>--homedir</strong> <em>dir</em>] [<strong>--options</strong> <em>file</em>] [<em>options</em>] <em>command</em> [<em>args</em>]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>gpg</strong> is the OpenPGP part of the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG). It is a tool to provide digital encryption and signing services using the OpenPGP standard. <strong>gpg</strong> features complete key management and all the bells and whistles you would expect from a full OpenPGP implementation.</p>
<p>There are two main versions of GnuPG: GnuPG 1.x and GnuPG 2.x. GnuPG 2.x supports modern encryption algorithms and thus should be preferred over GnuPG 1.x. You only need to use GnuPG 1.x if your platform doesn't support GnuPG 2.x, or you need support for some features that GnuPG 2.x has deprecated, e.g., decrypting data created with PGP-2 keys.</p>
<p>If you are looking for version 1 of GnuPG, you may find that version installed under the name <strong>gpg1</strong>.</p>
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1>
<p>The program returns 0 if there are no severe errors, 1 if at least a signature was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.</p>
<p>Note that signature verification requires exact knowledge of what has been signed and by whom it has beensigned. Using only the return code is thus not an appropriate way to verify a signature by a script. Either make proper use or the status codes or use the <strong>gpgv</strong> tool which has been designed to make signature verification easy for scripts.</p>
<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p>Use a good password for your user account and make sure that all security issues are always fixed on your machine. Also employ diligent physical protection to your machine. Consider to use a good passphrase as a last resort protection to your secret key in the case your machine gets stolen. It is important that your secret key is never leaked. Using an easy to carry around token or smartcard with the secret key is often a advisable.</p>
<p>If you are going to verify detached signatures, make sure that the program knows about it; either give both filenames on the command line or use ‘-’ to specify STDIN.</p>
<p>For scripted or other unattended use of <strong>gpg</strong> make sure to use the machine-parseable interface and not the default interface which is intended for direct use by humans. The machine-parseable interface provides a stable and well documented API independent of the locale or future changes of <strong>gpg</strong>. To enable this interface use the options <strong>--with-colons</strong> and <strong>--status-fd</strong>. For certain operations the option <strong>--command-fd</strong> may come handy too. See this man page and the file ‘<em>DETAILS</em>’ for the specification of the interface. Note that the GnuPG ``info'' pages as well as the PDF version of the GnuPG manual features a chapter on unattended use of GnuPG. As an alternative the library <strong>GPGME</strong> can be used as a high-level abstraction on top of that interface.</p>
<h1>INTEROPERABILITY</h1>
<p>GnuPG tries to be a very flexible implementation of the OpenPGP standard. In particular, GnuPG implements many of the optional parts of the standard, such as the SHA-512 hash, and the ZLIB and BZIP2 compression algorithms. It is important to be aware that not all OpenPGP programs implement these optional algorithms and that by forcing their use via the <strong>--cipher-algo</strong>, <strong>--digest-algo</strong>, <strong>--cert-digest-algo</strong>, or <strong>--compress-algo</strong> options in GnuPG, it is possible to create a perfectly valid OpenPGP message, but one that cannot be read by the intended recipient.</p>
<p>There are dozens of variations of OpenPGP programs available, and each supports a slightly different subset of these optional algorithms. For example, until recently, no (unhacked) version of PGP supported the BLOWFISH cipher algorithm. A message using BLOWFISH simply could not be read by a PGP user. By default, GnuPG uses the standard OpenPGP preferences system that will always do the right thing and create messages that are usable by all recipients, regardless of which OpenPGP program they use. Only override this safe default if you really know what you are doing.</p>
<p>If you absolutely must override the safe default, or if the preferences on a given key are invalid for some reason, you are far better off using the <strong>--pgp6</strong>, <strong>--pgp7</strong>, or <strong>--pgp8</strong> options. These options are safe as they do not force any particular algorithms in violation of OpenPGP, but rather reduce the available algorithms to a "PGP-safe" list.</p>
<h1>COMMANDS</h1>
<p>Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that only one command is allowed. Generally speaking, irrelevant options are silently ignored, and may not be checked for correctness.</p>
<p><strong>gpg</strong> may be run with no commands. In this case it will print a warning perform a reasonable action depending on the type of file it is given as input (an encrypted message is decrypted, a signature is verified, a file containing keys is listed, etc.).</p>
<p>If you run into any problems, please add the option <strong>--verbose</strong> to the invocation to see more diagnostics.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Commands to select the type of operation</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--sign</strong><br />
<strong>-s</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Sign a message. This command may be combined with <strong>--encrypt</strong> (to sign and encrypt a message), <strong>--symmetric</strong> (to sign and symmetrically encrypt a message), or both <strong>--encrypt</strong> and <strong>--symmetric</strong> (to sign and encrypt a message that can be decrypted using a secret key or a passphrase). The signing key is chosen by default or can be set explicitly using the <strong>--local-user</strong> and <strong>--default-key</strong> options.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--clear-sign</strong><br />
<strong>--clearsign</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Make a cleartext signature. The content in a cleartext signature is readable without any special software. OpenPGP software is only needed to verify the signature. cleartext signatures may modify end-of-line whitespace for platform independence and are not intended to be reversible. The signing key is chosen by default or can be set explicitly using the <strong>--local-user</strong> and <strong>--default-key</strong> options.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--detach-sign</strong><br />
<strong>-b</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Make a detached signature.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--encrypt</strong><br />
<strong>-e</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Encrypt data to one or more public keys. This command may be combined with <strong>--sign</strong> (to sign and encrypt a message), <strong>--symmetric</strong> (to encrypt a message that can be decrypted using a secret key or a passphrase), or <strong>--sign</strong> and <strong>--symmetric</strong> together (for a signed message that can be decrypted using a secret key or a passphrase). <strong>--recipient</strong> and related options specify which public keys to use for encryption.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--symmetric</strong><br />
<strong>-c</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Encrypt with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase. The default symmetric cipher used is AES-128, but may be chosen with the <strong>--cipher-algo</strong> option. This command may be combined with <strong>--sign</strong> (for a signed and symmetrically encrypted message), <strong>--encrypt</strong> (for a message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase), or <strong>--sign</strong> and <strong>--encrypt</strong> together (for a signed message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase). <strong>gpg</strong> caches the passphrase used for symmetric encryption so that a decrypt operation may not require that the user needs to enter the passphrase. The option <strong>--no-symkey-cache</strong> can be used to disable this feature.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--store</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Store only (make a simple literal data packet).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--decrypt</strong><br />
<strong>-d</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Decrypt the file given on the command line (or STDIN if no file is specified) and write it to STDOUT (or the file specified with <strong>--output</strong>). If the decrypted file is signed, the signature is also verified. This command differs from the default operation, as it never writes to the filename which is included in the file and it rejects files that don't begin with an encrypted message.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--verify</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Assume that the first argument is a signed file and verify it without generating any output. With no arguments, the signature packet is read from STDIN. If only one argument is given, the specified file is expected to include a complete signature.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>With more than one argument, the first argument should specify a file with a detached signature and the remaining files should contain the signed data. To read the signed data from STDIN, use ‘-’ as the second filename. For security reasons, a detached signature will not read the signed material from STDIN if not explicitly specified.</p>
<p>Note: If the option <strong>--batch</strong> is not used, <strong>gpg</strong> may assume that a single argument is a file with a detached signature, and it will try to find a matching data file by stripping certain suffixes. Using this historical feature to verify a detached signature is strongly discouraged; you should always specify the data file explicitly.</p>
<p>Note: When verifying a cleartext signature, <strong>gpg</strong> verifies only what makes up the cleartext signed data and not any extra data outside of the cleartext signature or the header lines directly following the dash marker line. The option <strong>--output</strong> may be used to write out the actual signed data, but there are other pitfalls with this format as well. It is suggested to avoid cleartext signatures in favor of detached signatures.</p>
<p>Note: Sometimes the use of the <strong>gpgv</strong> tool is easier than using the full-fledged <strong>gpg</strong> with this option. <strong>gpgv</strong> is designed to compare signed data against a list of trusted keys and returns with success only for a good signature. It has its own manual page.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--multifile</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This modifies certain other commands to accept multiple files for processing on the command line or read from STDIN with each filename on a separate line. This allows for many files to be processed at once. <strong>--multifile</strong> may currently be used along with <strong>--verify</strong>, <strong>--encrypt</strong>, and <strong>--decrypt</strong>. Note that <strong>--multifile --verify</strong> may not be used with detached signatures.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--verify-files</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Identical to <strong>--multifile --verify</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--encrypt-files</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Identical to <strong>--multifile --encrypt</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--decrypt-files</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Identical to <strong>--multifile --decrypt</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--list-keys</strong><br />
<strong>-k</strong><br />
<strong>--list-public-keys</strong></dt>
<dd><p>List the specified keys. If no keys are specified, then all keys from the configured public keyrings are listed.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Never use the output of this command in scripts or other programs. The output is intended only for humans and its format is likely to change. The <strong>--with-colons</strong> option emits the output in a stable, machine-parseable format, which is intended for use by scripts and other programs.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--list-secret-keys</strong><br />
<strong>-K</strong></dt>
<dd><p>List the specified secret keys. If no keys are specified, then all known secret keys are listed. A <strong>#</strong> after the initial tags <strong>sec</strong> or <strong>ssb</strong> means that the secret key or subkey is currently not usable. We also say that this key has been taken offline (for example, a primary key can be taken offline by exporting the key using the command <strong>--export-secret-subkeys</strong>). A <strong>&gt;</strong> after these tags indicate that the key is stored on a smartcard. See also <strong>--list-keys</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--check-signatures</strong><br />
<strong>--check-sigs</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Same as <strong>--list-keys</strong>, but the key signatures are verified and listed too. Note that for performance reasons the revocation status of a signing key is not shown. This command has the same effect as using <strong>--list-keys</strong> with <strong>--with-sig-check</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The status of the verification is indicated by a flag directly following the "sig" tag (and thus before the flags described below. A "!" indicates that the signature has been successfully verified, a "-" denotes a bad signature and a "%" is used if an error occurred while checking the signature (e.g. a non supported algorithm). Signatures where the public key is not available are not listed; to see their keyids the command <strong>--list-sigs</strong> can be used.</p>
<p>For each signature listed, there are several flags in between the signature status flag and keyid. These flags give additional information about each key signature. From left to right, they are the numbers 1-3 for certificate check level (see <strong>--ask-cert-level</strong>), "L" for a local or non-exportable signature (see <strong>--lsign-key</strong>), "R" for a nonRevocable signature (see the <strong>--edit-key</strong> command "nrsign"), "P" for a signature that contains a policy URL (see <strong>--cert-policy-url</strong>), "N" for a signature that contains a notation (see <strong>--cert-notation</strong>), "X" for an eXpired signature (see <strong>--ask-cert-expire</strong>), and the numbers 1-9 or "T" for 10 and above to indicate trust signature levels (see the <strong>--edit-key</strong> command "tsign").</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--locate-keys</strong><br />
<strong>--locate-external-keys</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Locate the keys given as arguments. This command basically uses the same algorithm as used when locating keys for encryption or signing and may thus be used to see what keys <strong>gpg</strong> might use. In particular external methods as defined by <strong>--auto-key-locate</strong> may be used to locate a key. Only public keys are listed. The variant <strong>--locate-external-keys</strong> does not consider a locally existing key and can thus be used to force the refresh of a key via the defined external methods.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--show-keys</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This commands takes OpenPGP keys as input and prints information about them in the same way the command <strong>--list-keys</strong> does for locally stored key. In addition the list options <strong>show-unusable-uids</strong>, <strong>show-unusable-subkeys</strong>, <strong>show-notations</strong> and <strong>show-policy-urls</strong> are also enabled. As usual for automated processing, this command should be combined with the option <strong>--with-colons</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--fingerprint</strong></dt>
<dd><p>List all keys (or the specified ones) along with their fingerprints. This is the same output as <strong>--list-keys</strong> but with the additional output of a line with the fingerprint. May also be combined with <strong>--check-signatures</strong>. If this command is given twice, the fingerprints of all secondary keys are listed too. This command also forces pretty printing of fingerprints if the keyid format has been set to "none".</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--list-packets</strong></dt>
<dd><p>List only the sequence of packets. This command is only useful for debugging. When used with option <strong>--verbose</strong> the actual MPI values are dumped and not only their lengths. Note that the output of this command may change with new releases.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--edit-card</strong><br />
<strong>--card-edit</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Present a menu to work with a smartcard. The subcommand "help" provides an overview on available commands. For a detailed description, please see the Card HOWTO at https://gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html#GnuPG-cardHOWTO .</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--card-status</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Show the content of the smart card.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--change-pin</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Present a menu to allow changing the PIN of a smartcard. This functionality is also available as the subcommand "passwd" with the <strong>--edit-card</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--delete-keys <em>name</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>Remove key from the public keyring. In batch mode either <strong>--yes</strong> is required or the key must be specified by fingerprint. This is a safeguard against accidental deletion of multiple keys. If the exclamation mark syntax is used with the fingerprint of a subkey only that subkey is deleted; if the exclamation mark is used with the fingerprint of the primary key the entire public key is deleted.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--delete-secret-keys <em>name</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>Remove key from the secret keyring. In batch mode the key must be specified by fingerprint. The option <strong>--yes</strong> can be used to advise gpg-agent not to request a confirmation. This extra pre-caution is done because <strong>gpg</strong> can't be sure that the secret key (as controlled by gpg-agent) is only used for the given OpenPGP public key. If the exclamation mark syntax is used with the fingerprint of a subkey only the secret part of that subkey is deleted; if the exclamation mark is used with the fingerprint of the primary key only the secret part of the primary key is deleted.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--delete-secret-and-public-key <em>name</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>Same as <strong>--delete-key</strong>, but if a secret key exists, it will be removed first. In batch mode the key must be specified by fingerprint. The option <strong>--yes</strong> can be used to advise gpg-agent not to request a confirmation.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--export</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Either export all keys from all keyrings (default keyrings and those registered via option <strong>--keyring</strong>), or if at least one name is given, those of the given name. The exported keys are written to STDOUT or to the file given with option <strong>--output</strong>. Use together with <strong>--armor</strong> to mail those keys.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--send-keys <em>keyIDs</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>Similar to <strong>--export</strong> but sends the keys to a keyserver. Fingerprints may be used instead of key IDs. Don't send your complete keyring to a keyserver --- select only those keys which are new or changed by you. If no <em>keyIDs</em> are given, <strong>gpg</strong> does nothing.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Take care: Keyservers are by design write only systems and thus it is not possible to ever delete keys once they have been send to a keyserver.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--export-secret-keys</strong><br />
<strong>--export-secret-subkeys</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Same as <strong>--export</strong>, but exports the secret keys instead. The exported keys are written to STDOUT or to the file given with option <strong>--output</strong>. This command is often used along with the option <strong>--armor</strong> to allow for easy printing of the key for paper backup; however the external tool <strong>paperkey</strong> does a better job of creating backups on paper. Note that exporting a secret key can be a security risk if the exported keys are sent over an insecure channel.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The second form of the command has the special property to render the secret part of the primary key useless; this is a GNU extension to OpenPGP and other implementations can not be expected to successfully import such a key. Its intended use is in generating a full key with an additional signing subkey on a dedicated machine. This command then exports the key without the primary key to the main machine.</p>
<p>GnuPG may ask you to enter the passphrase for the key. This is required, because the internal protection method of the secret key is different from the one specified by the OpenPGP protocol.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--export-ssh-key</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This command is used to export a key in the OpenSSH public key format. It requires the specification of one key by the usual means and exports the latest valid subkey which has an authentication capability to STDOUT or to the file given with option <strong>--output</strong>. That output can directly be added to ssh's ‘<em>authorized_key</em>’ file.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>By specifying the key to export using a key ID or a fingerprint suffixed with an exclamation mark (!), a specific subkey or the primary key can be exported. This does not even require that the key has the authentication capability flag set.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--import</strong><br />
<strong>--fast-import</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Import/merge keys. This adds the given keys to the keyring. The fast version is currently just a synonym.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are a few other options which control how this command works. Most notable here is the <strong>--import-options merge-only</strong> option which does not insert new keys but does only the merging of new signatures, user-IDs and subkeys.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--receive-keys <em>keyIDs</em></strong><br />
<strong>--recv-keys <em>keyIDs</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>Import the keys with the given <em>keyIDs</em> from a keyserver.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--refresh-keys</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Request updates from a keyserver for keys that already exist on the local keyring. This is useful for updating a key with the latest signatures, user IDs, etc. Calling this with no arguments will refresh the entire keyring.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--search-keys <em>names</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>Search the keyserver for the given <em>names</em>. Multiple names given here will be joined together to create the search string for the keyserver. Note that keyservers search for <em>names</em> in a different and simpler way than gpg does. The best choice is to use a mail address. Due to data privacy reasons keyservers may even not even allow searching by user id or mail address and thus may only return results when being used with the <strong>--recv-key</strong> command to search by key fingerprint or keyid.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--fetch-keys <em>URIs</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>Retrieve keys located at the specified <em>URIs</em>. Note that different installations of GnuPG may support different protocols (HTTP, FTP, LDAP, etc.). When using HTTPS the system provided root certificates are used by this command.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--update-trustdb</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Do trust database maintenance. This command iterates over all keys and builds the Web of Trust. This is an interactive command because it may have to ask for the "ownertrust" values for keys. The user has to give an estimation of how far she trusts the owner of the displayed key to correctly certify (sign) other keys. GnuPG only asks for the ownertrust value if it has not yet been assigned to a key. Using the <strong>--edit-key</strong> menu, the assigned value can be changed at any time.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--check-trustdb</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Do trust database maintenance without user interaction. From time to time the trust database must be updated so that expired keys or signatures and the resulting changes in the Web of Trust can be tracked. Normally, GnuPG will calculate when this is required and do it automatically unless <strong>--no-auto-check-trustdb</strong> is set. This command can be used to force a trust database check at any time. The processing is identical to that of <strong>--update-trustdb</strong> but it skips keys with a not yet defined "ownertrust".</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For use with cron jobs, this command can be used together with <strong>--batch</strong> in which case the trust database check is done only if a check is needed. To force a run even in batch mode add the option <strong>--yes</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--export-ownertrust</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Send the ownertrust values to STDOUT. This is useful for backup purposes as these values are the only ones which can't be re-created from a corrupted trustdb. Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  gpg --export-ownertrust &gt; otrust.txt</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--import-ownertrust</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Update the trustdb with the ownertrust values stored in <strong>files</strong> (or STDIN if not given); existing values will be overwritten. In case of a severely damaged trustdb and if you have a recent backup of the ownertrust values (e.g. in the file ‘<em>otrust.txt</em>’), you may re-create the trustdb using these commands:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  cd ~/.gnupg
  rm trustdb.gpg
  gpg --import-ownertrust &lt; otrust.txt</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--rebuild-keydb-caches</strong></dt>
<dd><p>When updating from version 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 this command should be used to create signature caches in the keyring. It might be handy in other situations too.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--print-md <em>algo</em></strong><br />
<strong>--print-mds</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Print message digest of algorithm <em>algo</em> for all given files or STDIN. With the second form (or a deprecated "*" for <em>algo</em>) digests for all available algorithms are printed.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--gen-random <em>0|1|2</em> <em>count</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>Emit <em>count</em> random bytes of the given quality level 0, 1 or 2. If <em>count</em> is not given or zero, an endless sequence of random bytes will be emitted. If used with <strong>--armor</strong> the output will be base64 encoded. PLEASE, don't use this command unless you know what you are doing; it may remove precious entropy from the system!</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--gen-prime <em>mode</em> <em>bits</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>Use the source, Luke :-). The output format is subject to change with ant release.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--enarmor</strong><br />
<strong>--dearmor</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Pack or unpack an arbitrary input into/from an OpenPGP ASCII armor. This is a GnuPG extension to OpenPGP and in general not very useful.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--tofu-policy {auto|good|unknown|bad|ask} <em>keys</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>Set the TOFU policy for all the bindings associated with the specified <em>keys</em>. For more information about the meaning of the policies, see: [trust-model-tofu]. The <em>keys</em> may be specified either by their fingerprint (preferred) or their keyid.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>How to manage your keys</h2>
<p>This section explains the main commands for key management.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--quick-generate-key <em>user-id</em> [<em>algo</em> [<em>usage</em> [<em>expire</em>]]]</strong><br />
<strong>--quick-gen-key</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is a simple command to generate a standard key with one user id. In contrast to <strong>--generate-key</strong> the key is generated directly without the need to answer a bunch of prompts. Unless the option <strong>--yes</strong> is given, the key creation will be canceled if the given user id already exists in the keyring.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If invoked directly on the console without any special options an answer to a ``Continue?'' style confirmation prompt is required. In case the user id already exists in the keyring a second prompt to force the creation of the key will show up.</p>
<p>If <em>algo</em> or <em>usage</em> are given, only the primary key is created and no prompts are shown. To specify an expiration date but still create a primary and subkey use ``default'' or ``future-default'' for <em>algo</em> and ``default'' for <em>usage</em>. For a description of these optional arguments see the command <strong>--quick-add-key</strong>. The <em>usage</em> accepts also the value ``cert'' which can be used to create a certification only primary key; the default is to a create certification and signing key.</p>
<p>The <em>expire</em> argument can be used to specify an expiration date for the key. Several formats are supported; commonly the ISO formats ``YYYY-MM-DD'' or ``YYYYMMDDThhmmss'' are used. To make the key expire in N seconds, N days, N weeks, N months, or N years use ``seconds=N'', ``Nd'', ``Nw'', ``Nm'', or ``Ny'' respectively. Not specifying a value, or using ``-'' results in a key expiring in a reasonable default interval. The values ``never'', ``none'' can be used for no expiration date.</p>
<p>If this command is used with <strong>--batch</strong>, <strong>--pinentry-mode</strong> has been set to <strong>loopback</strong>, and one of the passphrase options (<strong>--passphrase</strong>, <strong>--passphrase-fd</strong>, or <strong>passphrase-file</strong>) is used, the supplied passphrase is used for the new key and the agent does not ask for it. To create a key without any protection <strong>--passphrase ''</strong> may be used.</p>
<p>To create an OpenPGP key from the keys available on the currently inserted smartcard, the special string ``card'' can be used for <em>algo</em>. If the card features an encryption and a signing key, gpg will figure them out and creates an OpenPGP key consisting of the usual primary key and one subkey. This works only with certain smartcards. Note that the interactive <strong>--full-gen-key</strong> command allows to do the same but with greater flexibility in the selection of the smartcard keys.</p>
<p>Note that it is possible to create a primary key and a subkey using non-default algorithms by using ``default'' and changing the default parameters using the option <strong>--default-new-key-algo</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--quick-set-expire <em>fpr</em> <em>expire</em> [*|<em>subfprs</em>]</strong></dt>
<dd><p>With two arguments given, directly set the expiration time of the primary key identified by <em>fpr</em> to <em>expire</em>. To remove the expiration time <strong>0</strong> can be used. With three arguments and the third given as an asterisk, the expiration time of all non-revoked and not yet expired subkeys are set to <em>expire</em>. With more than two arguments and a list of fingerprints given for <em>subfprs</em>, all non-revoked subkeys matching these fingerprints are set to <em>expire</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--quick-add-key <em>fpr</em> [<em>algo</em> [<em>usage</em> [<em>expire</em>]]]</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Directly add a subkey to the key identified by the fingerprint <em>fpr</em>. Without the optional arguments an encryption subkey is added. If any of the arguments are given a more specific subkey is added.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>algo</em> may be any of the supported algorithms or curve names given in the format as used by key listings. To use the default algorithm the string ``default'' or ``-'' can be used. Supported algorithms are ``rsa'', ``dsa'', ``elg'', ``ed25519'', ``cv25519'', and other ECC curves. For example the string ``rsa'' adds an RSA key with the default key length; a string ``rsa4096'' requests that the key length is 4096 bits. The string ``future-default'' is an alias for the algorithm which will likely be used as default algorithm in future versions of gpg. To list the supported ECC curves the command <strong>gpg --with-colons --list-config curve</strong> can be used.</p>
<p>Depending on the given <em>algo</em> the subkey may either be an encryption subkey or a signing subkey. If an algorithm is capable of signing and encryption and such a subkey is desired, a <em>usage</em> string must be given. This string is either ``default'' or ``-'' to keep the default or a comma delimited list (or space delimited list) of keywords: ``sign'' for a signing subkey, ``auth'' for an authentication subkey, and ``encr'' for an encryption subkey (``encrypt'' can be used as alias for ``encr''). The valid combinations depend on the algorithm.</p>
<p>The <em>expire</em> argument can be used to specify an expiration date for the key. Several formats are supported; commonly the ISO formats ``YYYY-MM-DD'' or ``YYYYMMDDThhmmss'' are used. To make the key expire in N seconds, N days, N weeks, N months, or N years use ``seconds=N'', ``Nd'', ``Nw'', ``Nm'', or ``Ny'' respectively. Not specifying a value, or using ``-'' results in a key expiring in a reasonable default interval. The values ``never'', ``none'' can be used for no expiration date.</p>

<p>This command merely creates the revocation certificate so that it can be used to revoke the key if that is ever needed. To actually revoke a key the created revocation certificate needs to be merged with the key to revoke. This is done by importing the revocation certificate using the <strong>--import</strong> command. Then the revoked key needs to be published, which is best done by sending the key to a keyserver (command <strong>--send-key</strong>) and by exporting (<strong>--export</strong>) it to a file which is then send to frequent communication partners.</p>

<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>gpg</strong> features a bunch of options to control the exact behaviour and to change the default configuration.</p>
<p>Long options can be put in an options file (default "~/.gnupg/gpg.conf"). Short option names will not work - for example, "armor" is a valid option for the options file, while "a" is not. Do not write the 2 dashes, but simply the name of the option and any required arguments. Lines with a hash ('#') as the first non-white-space character are ignored. Commands may be put in this file too, but that is not generally useful as the command will execute automatically with every execution of gpg.</p>
<p>Please remember that option parsing stops as soon as a non-option is encountered, you can explicitly stop parsing by using the special option <strong>--</strong>.</p>
<h2>How to change the configuration</h2>
<p>These options are used to change the configuration and are usually found in the option file.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--default-key <em>name</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>Use <em>name</em> as the default key to sign with. If this option is not used, the default key is the first key found in the secret keyring. Note that <strong>-u</strong> or <strong>--local-user</strong> overrides this option. This option may be given multiple times. In this case, the last key for which a secret key is available is used. If there is no secret key available for any of the specified values, GnuPG will not emit an error message but continue as if this option wasn't given.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--default-recipient <em>name</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>Use <em>name</em> as default recipient if option <strong>--recipient</strong> is not used and don't ask if this is a valid one. <em>name</em> must be non-empty.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--default-recipient-self</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Use the default key as default recipient if option <strong>--recipient</strong> is not used and don't ask if this is a valid one. The default key is the first one from the secret keyring or the one set with <strong>--default-key</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<dt><strong>--no-default-recipient</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Reset <strong>--default-recipient</strong> and <strong>--default-recipient-self</strong>.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>--batch</strong><br />
<strong>--no-batch</strong></dt>

</dl>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><strong>pgp</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is the Web of Trust combined with trust signatures as used in PGP 5.x and later. This is the default trust model when creating a new trust database.</p>
</dd>

<dd><p>This is the standard Web of Trust as introduced by PGP 2.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>tofu</strong></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>TOFU stands for Trust On First Use. In this trust model, the first time a key is seen, it is memorized. If later another key with a user id with the same email address is seen, both keys are marked as suspect. In that case, the next time either is used, a warning is displayed describing the conflict, why it might have occurred (either the user generated a new key and failed to cross sign the old and new keys, the key is forgery, or a man-in-the-middle attack is being attempted), and the user is prompted to manually confirm the validity of the key in question.</p>
<p>Because a potential attacker is able to control the email address and thereby circumvent the conflict detection algorithm by using an email address that is similar in appearance to a trusted email address, whenever a message is verified, statistics about the number of messages signed with the key are shown. In this way, a user can easily identify attacks using fake keys for regular correspondents.</p>
<p>When compared with the Web of Trust, TOFU offers significantly weaker security guarantees. In particular, TOFU only helps ensure consistency (that is, that the binding between a key and email address doesn't change). A major advantage of TOFU is that it requires little maintenance to use correctly. To use the web of trust properly, you need to actively sign keys and mark users as trusted introducers. This is a time-consuming process and anecdotal evidence suggests that even security-conscious users rarely take the time to do this thoroughly and instead rely on an ad-hoc TOFU process.</p>
<p>In the TOFU model, policies are associated with bindings between keys and email addresses (which are extracted from user ids and normalized). There are five policies, which can be set manually using the <strong>--tofu-policy</strong> option. The default policy can be set using the <strong>--tofu-default-policy</strong> option.</p>
<p>The TOFU policies are: <strong>auto</strong>, <strong>good</strong>, <strong>unknown</strong>, <strong>bad</strong> and <strong>ask</strong>. The <strong>auto</strong> policy is used by default (unless overridden by <strong>--tofu-default-policy</strong>) and marks a binding as marginally trusted. The <strong>good</strong>, <strong>unknown</strong> and <strong>bad</strong> policies mark a binding as fully trusted, as having unknown trust or as having trust never, respectively. The <strong>unknown</strong> policy is useful for just using TOFU to detect conflicts, but to never assign positive trust to a binding. The final policy, <strong>ask</strong> prompts the user to indicate the binding's trust. If batch mode is enabled (or input is inappropriate in the context), then the user is not prompted and the <strong>undefined</strong> trust level is returned.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>tofu+pgp</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This trust model combines TOFU with the Web of Trust. This is done by computing the trust level for each model and then taking the maximum trust level where the trust levels are ordered as follows: <strong>unknown &lt; undefined &lt; marginal &lt; fully &lt; ultimate &lt; expired &lt;</strong> never.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>By setting <strong>--tofu-default-policy=unknown</strong>, this model can be used to implement the web of trust with TOFU's conflict detection algorithm, but without its assignment of positive trust values, which some security-conscious users don't like.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>direct</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Key validity is set directly by the user and not calculated via the Web of Trust. This model is solely based on the key and does not distinguish user IDs.

<dt><strong>always</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Skip key validation and assume that used keys are always fully valid. You generally won't use this unless you are using some external validation scheme.

<h2>Key related options</h2>

<dt><strong>--recipient <em>name</em></strong><br />
<strong>-r</strong></dt>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--hidden-recipient <em>name</em></strong><br />
<strong>-R</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Encrypt for user ID <em>name</em>, but hide the key ID of this user's key. This option helps to hide the receiver of the message and is a limited countermeasure against traffic analysis. If this option or <strong>--recipient</strong> is not specified, GnuPG asks for the user ID unless <strong>--default-recipient</strong> is given.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--recipient-file <em>file</em></strong><br />
<strong>-f</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This option is similar to <strong>--recipient</strong> except that it encrypts to a key stored in the given file. <em>file</em> must be the name of a file containing exactly one key. <strong>gpg</strong> assumes that the key in this file is fully valid.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--hidden-recipient-file <em>file</em></strong><br />
<strong>-F</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This option is similar to <strong>--hidden-recipient</strong> except that it encrypts to a key stored in the given file. <em>file</em> must be the name of a file containing exactly one key. <strong>gpg</strong> assumes that the key in this file is fully valid.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--encrypt-to <em>name</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>Same as <strong>--recipient</strong> but this one is intended for use in the options file and may be used with your own user-id as an "encrypt-to-self". These keys are only used when there are other recipients given either by use of <strong>--recipient</strong> or by the asked user id. No trust checking is performed for these user ids and even disabled keys can be used.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--hidden-encrypt-to <em>name</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>Same as <strong>--hidden-recipient</strong> but this one is intended for use in the options file and may be used with your own user-id as a hidden "encrypt-to-self". These keys are only used when there are other recipients given either by use of <strong>--recipient</strong> or by the asked user id. No trust checking is performed for these user ids and even disabled keys can be used.</p>
</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--group {<em>name</em>=<em>value</em>}</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Sets up a named group, which is similar to aliases in email programs. Any time the group name is a recipient (<strong>-r</strong> or <strong>--recipient</strong>), it will be expanded to the values specified. Multiple groups with the same name are automatically merged into a single group.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The values are <strong>key IDs</strong> or fingerprints, but any key description is accepted. Note that a value with spaces in it will be treated as two different values. Note also there is only one level of expansion --- you cannot make an group that points to another group. When used from the command line, it may be necessary to quote the argument to this option to prevent the shell from treating it as multiple arguments.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--ungroup <em>name</em></strong></dt>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--sender <em>mbox</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>This option has two purposes. <em>mbox</em> must either be a complete user id with a proper mail address or just a mail address. When creating a signature this option tells gpg the user id of a key used to make a signature if the key was not directly specified by a user id. When verifying a signature the <em>mbox</em> is used to restrict the information printed by the TOFU code to matching user ids.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--try-secret-key <em>name</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>For hidden recipients GPG needs to know the keys to use for trial decryption. The key set with <strong>--default-key</strong> is always tried first, but this is often not sufficient. This option allows setting more keys to be used for trial decryption. Although any valid user-id specification may be used for <em>name</em> it makes sense to use at least the long keyid to avoid ambiguities. Note that gpg-agent might pop up a pinentry for a lot keys to do the trial decryption. If you want to stop all further trial decryption you may use close-window button instead of the cancel button.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--try-all-secrets</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Don't look at the key ID as stored in the message but try all secret keys in turn to find the right decryption key. This option forces the behaviour as used by anonymous recipients (created by using <strong>--throw-keyids</strong> or <strong>--hidden-recipient</strong>) and might come handy in case where an encrypted message contains a bogus key ID.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--skip-hidden-recipients</strong><br />
<strong>--no-skip-hidden-recipients</strong></dt>
<dd><p>During decryption skip all anonymous recipients. This option helps in the case that people use the hidden recipients feature to hide their own encrypt-to key from others. If one has many secret keys this may lead to a major annoyance because all keys are tried in turn to decrypt something which was not really intended for it. The drawback of this option is that it is currently not possible to decrypt a message which includes real anonymous recipients.</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--max-output <em>n</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>This option sets a limit on the number of bytes that will be generated when processing a file. Since OpenPGP supports various levels of compression, it is possible that the plaintext of a given message may be significantly larger than the original OpenPGP message. While GnuPG works properly with such messages, there is often a desire to set a maximum file size that will be generated before processing is forced to stop by the OS limits. Defaults to 0, which means "no limit".</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--input-size-hint <em>n</em></strong></dt>
<dd><p>This option can be used to tell GPG the size of the input data in bytes. <em>n</em> must be a positive base-10 number. This option is only useful if the input is not taken from a file. GPG may use this hint to optimize its buffer allocation strategy. It is also used by the <strong>--status-fd</strong> line ``PROGRESS'' to provide a value for ``total'' if that is not available by other means.</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--key-origin <em>string</em>[,<em>url</em>]</strong></dt>
<dd><p>gpg can track the origin of a key. Certain origins are implicitly known (e.g. keyserver, web key directory) and set. For a standard import the origin of the keys imported can be set with this option. To list the possible values use "help" for <em>string</em>. Some origins can store an optional <em>url</em> argument. That URL can appended to <em>string</em> after a comma.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>--import-options <em>parameters</em></strong></dt>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>keep-ownertrust</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Normally possible still existing ownertrust values of a key are cleared if a key is imported. This is in general desirable so that a formerly deleted key does not automatically gain an ownertrust values merely due to import. On the other hand it is sometimes necessary to re-import a trusted set of keys again but keeping already assigned ownertrust values. This can be achieved by using this option.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>repair-pks-subkey-bug</strong></dt>
<dd><p>During import, attempt to repair the damage caused by the PKS keyserver bug (pre version 0.9.6) that mangles keys with multiple subkeys. Note that this cannot completely repair the damaged key as some crucial data is removed by the keyserver, but it does at least give you back one subkey. Defaults to no for regular <strong>--import</strong> and to yes for keyserver <strong>--receive-keys</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>import-show</strong><br />
<strong>show-only</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Show a listing of the key as imported right before it is stored. This can be combined with the option <strong>--dry-run</strong> to only look at keys; the option <strong>show-only</strong> is a shortcut for this combination. The command <strong>--show-keys</strong> is another shortcut for this. Note that suffixes like '#' for "sec" and "sbb" lines may or may not be printed.</p>
</dd>

<dl>
<dt><strong>import-export</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Run the entire import code but instead of storing the key to the local keyring write it to the output.

Defaults to no.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>self-sigs-only</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Accept only self-signatures while importing a key. All other key signatures are skipped at an early import stage. This option can be used with <strong>keyserver-options</strong> to mitigate attempts to flood a key with bogus signatures from a keyserver. The drawback is that all other valid key signatures, as required by the Web of Trust are also not imported. Note that when using this option along with import-clean it suppresses the final clean step after merging the imported key into the existing key.</p>

<p>ZLIB may give better compression results than ZIP, as the compression window size is not limited to 8k. BZIP2 may give even better compression results than that, but will use a significantly larger amount of memory while compressing and decompressing. This may be significant in low memory situations. Note, however, that PGP (all versions) only supports ZIP compression. Using any algorithm other than ZIP or "none" will make the message unreadable with PGP.

<h1>HOW TO SPECIFY A USER ID</h1>
<p>There are different ways to specify a user ID to GnuPG. Some of them are only valid for <strong>gpg</strong> others are only good for <strong>gpgsm</strong>. Here is the entire list of ways to specify a key:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>By key Id.</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This format is deduced from the length of the string and its content or <strong>0x</strong> prefix. The key Id of an X.509 certificate are the low 64 bits of its SHA-1 fingerprint. The use of key Ids is just a shortcut, for all automated processing the fingerprint should be used.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When using <strong>gpg</strong> an exclamation mark (!) may be appended to force using the specified primary or secondary key and not to try and calculate which primary or secondary key to use.</p>
<p>The last four lines of the example give the key ID in their long form as internally used by the OpenPGP protocol. You can see the long key ID using the option <strong>--with-colons</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>234567C4
0F34E556E
01347A56A
0xAB123456

234AABBCC34567C4
0F323456784E56EAB
01AB3FED1347A5612
0x234AABBCC34567C4</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><strong>By fingerprint.</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This format is deduced from the length of the string and its content or the <strong>0x</strong> prefix. Note, that only the 20 byte version fingerprint is available with <strong>gpgsm</strong> (i.e. the SHA-1 hash of the certificate).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When using <strong>gpg</strong> an exclamation mark (!) may be appended to force using the specified primary or secondary key and not to try and calculate which primary or secondary key to use.</p>
<p>The best way to specify a key Id is by using the fingerprint. This avoids any ambiguities in case that there are duplicated key IDs.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>1234343434343434C434343434343434
123434343434343C3434343434343734349A3434
0E12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434
0xE12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>gpgsm</strong> also accepts colons between each pair of hexadecimal digits because this is the de-facto standard on how to present X.509 fingerprints. <strong>gpg</strong> also allows the use of the space separated SHA-1 fingerprint as printed by the key listing commands.</p>

<p>Please note that we have reused the hash mark identifier which was used in old GnuPG versions to indicate the so called local-id. It is not anymore used and there should be no conflict when used with X.509 stuff.</p>
<p>Using the RFC-2253 format of DNs has the drawback that it is not possible to map them back to the original encoding, however we don't have to do this because our key database stores this encoding as meta data.</p>
<h1>FILTER EXPRESSIONS</h1>
<p>The options <strong>--import-filter</strong> and <strong>--export-filter</strong> use expressions with this syntax (square brackets indicate an optional part and curly braces a repetition, white space between the elements are allowed):</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  [lc] {[{flag}] PROPNAME op VALUE [lc]}</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The name of a property (<em>PROPNAME</em>) may only consist of letters, digits and underscores. The description for the filter type describes which properties are defined. If an undefined property is used it evaluates to the empty string. Unless otherwise noted, the <em>VALUE</em> must always be given and may not be the empty string. No quoting is defined for the value, thus the value may not contain the strings <strong>&amp;&amp;</strong> or <strong>||</strong>, which are used as logical connection operators. The flag <strong>--</strong> can be used to remove this restriction.</p>
<p>Numerical values are computed as long int; standard C notation applies. <em>lc</em> is the logical connection operator; either <strong>&amp;&amp;</strong> for a conjunction or <strong>||</strong> for a disjunction. A conjunction is assumed at the begin of an expression. Conjunctions have higher precedence than disjunctions. If <em>VALUE</em> starts with one of the characters used in any <em>op</em> a space after the <em>op</em> is required.</p>
<p>The supported operators (<em>op</em>) are:</p>

<h1>TRUST VALUES</h1>
<p>Trust values are used to indicate ownertrust and validity of keys and user IDs. They are displayed with letters or strings:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-</strong><br />
<strong>unknown</strong></dt>
<dd><p>No ownertrust assigned / not yet calculated.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>e</strong><br />
<strong>expired</strong></dt>
<dd>

<strong>undefined, undef</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Not enough information for calculation.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>n</strong><br />
<strong>never</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Never trust this key.</p>

<dt><strong>m</strong><br />
<strong>marginal</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Marginally trusted.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>f</strong><br />
<strong>full</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Fully trusted.</p>

<strong>ultimate</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Ultimately trusted.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>r</strong><br />
<strong>revoked</strong></dt>
<dd><p>For validity only: the key or the user ID has been revoked.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>?</strong><br />
<strong>err</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The program encountered an unknown trust value.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<p>There are a few configuration files to control certain aspects of <strong>gpg</strong>'s operation. Unless noted, they are expected in the current home directory (see: [option --homedir]).</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>gpg.conf</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is the standard configuration file read by <strong>gpg</strong> on startup. It may contain any valid long option; the leading two dashes may not be entered and the option may not be abbreviated. This default name may be changed on the command line (see: [gpg-option --options]). You should backup this file.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that on larger installations, it is useful to put predefined files into the directory ‘<em>/etc/skel/.gnupg</em>’ so that newly created users start up with a working configuration. For existing users a small helper script is provided to create these files (see: [addgnupghome]).</p>
<p>For internal purposes <strong>gpg</strong> creates and maintains a few other files; They all live in the current home directory (see: [option --homedir]). Only the <strong>gpg</strong> program may modify these files.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>~/.gnupg</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is the default home directory which is used if neither the environment variable <strong>GNUPGHOME</strong> nor the option <strong>--homedir</strong> is given.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The public keyring using a legacy format. You should backup this file.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If this file is not available, <strong>gpg</strong> defaults to the new keybox format and creates a file ‘<em>pubring.kbx</em>’ unless that file already exists in which case that file will also be used for OpenPGP keys.</p>
<p>Note that in the case that both files, ‘<em>pubring.gpg</em>’ and ‘<em>pubring.kbx</em>’ exists but the latter has no OpenPGP keys, the legacy file ‘<em>pubring.gpg</em>’ will be used. Take care: GnuPG versions before 2.1 will always use the file ‘<em>pubring.gpg</em>’ because they do not know about the new keybox format. In the case that you have to use GnuPG 1.4 to decrypt archived data you should keep this file.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg.lock</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The lock file for the public keyring.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The public keyring using the new keybox format. This file is shared with <strong>gpgsm</strong>. You should backup this file. See above for the relation between this file and it predecessor.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To convert an existing ‘<em>pubring.gpg</em>’ file to the keybox format, you first backup the ownertrust values, then rename ‘<em>pubring.gpg</em>’ to ‘<em>publickeys.backup</em>’, so it won’t be recognized by any GnuPG version, run import, and finally restore the ownertrust values:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ cd ~/.gnupg
$ gpg --export-ownertrust &gt;otrust.lst
$ mv pubring.gpg publickeys.backup
$ gpg --import-options restore --import publickeys.backups
$ gpg --import-ownertrust otrust.lst</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><strong>~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx.lock</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The lock file for ‘<em>pubring.kbx</em>’.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>~/.gnupg/secring.gpg</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The legacy secret keyring as used by GnuPG versions before 2.1. It is not used by GnuPG 2.1 and later. You may want to keep it in case you have to use GnuPG 1.4 to decrypt archived data.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>~/.gnupg/secring.gpg.lock</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The lock file for the legacy secret keyring.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>~/.gnupg/.gpg-v21-migrated</strong></dt>
<dd><p>File indicating that a migration to GnuPG 2.1 has been done.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The trust database. There is no need to backup this file; it is better to backup the ownertrust values (see: [option --export-ownertrust]).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg.lock</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The lock file for the trust database.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>~/.gnupg/random_seed</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A file used to preserve the state of the internal random pool.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>~/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is the directory where gpg stores pre-generated revocation certificates. The file name corresponds to the OpenPGP fingerprint of the respective key. It is suggested to backup those certificates and if the primary private key is not stored on the disk to move them to an external storage device. Anyone who can access theses files is able to revoke the corresponding key. You may want to print them out. You should backup all files in this directory and take care to keep this backup closed away.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Operation is further controlled by a few environment variables:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>HOME</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Used to locate the default home directory.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>GNUPGHOME</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If set directory used instead of "~/.gnupg".</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>GPG_AGENT_INFO</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This variable is obsolete; it was used by GnuPG versions before 2.1.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>PINENTRY_USER_DATA</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This value is passed via gpg-agent to pinentry. It is useful to convey extra information to a custom pinentry.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>COLUMNS</strong><br />
<strong>LINES</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Used to size some displays to the full size of the screen.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>LANGUAGE</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Apart from its use by GNU, it is used in the W32 version to override the language selection done through the Registry. If used and set to a valid and available language name (<em>langid</em>), the file with the translation is loaded from <em>gpgdir</em>/gnupg.nls/<em>langid</em>.mo. Here <em>gpgdir</em> is the directory out of which the gpg binary has been loaded. If it can't be loaded the Registry is tried and as last resort the native Windows locale system is used.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When calling the gpg-agent component <strong>gpg</strong> sends a set of environment variables to gpg-agent. The names of these variables can be listed using the command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  gpg-connect-agent &#39;getinfo std_env_names&#39; /bye | awk &#39;$1==&quot;D&quot; {print $2}&#39;</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<p>On older systems this program should be installed as setuid(root). This is necessary to lock memory pages. Locking memory pages prevents the operating system from writing memory pages (which may contain passphrases or other sensitive material) to disk. If you get no warning message about insecure memory your operating system supports locking without being root. The program drops root privileges as soon as locked memory is allocated.</p>
<p>Note also that some systems (especially laptops) have the ability to ``suspend to disk'' (also known as ``safe sleep'' or ``hibernate''). This writes all memory to disk before going into a low power or even powered off mode. Unless measures are taken in the operating system to protect the saved memory, passphrases or other sensitive material may be recoverable from it later.</p>
<p>Before you report a bug you should first search the mailing list archives for similar problems and second check whether such a bug has already been reported to our bug tracker at <strong>https://bugs.gnupg.org</strong>.</p>

<p>The full documentation for this tool is maintained as a Texinfo manual. If GnuPG and the info program are properly installed at your site, the command</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>info gnupg</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>should give you access to the complete manual including a menu structure and an index.</p>
