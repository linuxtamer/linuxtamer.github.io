<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>con2fbmap - shows and sets mapping between consoles and framebuffer devices.</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>con2fbmap</strong> console [<em>framebuffer</em>]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>This documentation is not finished</strong></p>
<p><strong>con2fbmap</strong> is a system utility to show or change the mapping of the consoles to the frame buffer device. The frame buffer device provides a simple and unique interface to access different kinds of graphic displays.</p>
<p>Frame buffer devices are accessed via special device nodes located in the /dev directory. The naming scheme for these nodes is always <em><strong>fb</strong></em>&lt;<em>n</em>&gt;, where <em>n</em> is the number of the used frame buffer device.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The first option must be there, and identify the console on which to work. If the second option is not set, con2fbmap shows the current mapping of identified console. If the second argument is given (as a number) con2fbmap maps the identified console to said framebuffer device.</p>
