<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>git-merge-index - Run a merge for files needing merging</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>git merge-index [-o] [-q] &lt;merge-program&gt; (-a | [--] &lt;file&gt;*)</code></pre>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This looks up the &lt;file&gt;(s) in the index and, if there are any merge entries, passes the SHA-1 hash for those files as arguments 1, 2, 3 (empty argument if no file), and &lt;file&gt; as argument 4. File modes for the three files are passed as arguments 5, 6 and 7.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p>--</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not interpret any more arguments as options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run merge against all files in the index that need merging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-o</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of stopping at the first failed merge, do all of them in one shot - continue with merging even when previous merges returned errors, and only return the error code after all the merges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-q</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not complain about a failed merge program (a merge program failure usually indicates conflicts during the merge). This is for porcelains which might want to emit custom messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If <em>git merge-index</em> is called with multiple &lt;file&gt;s (or -a) then it processes them in turn only stopping if merge returns a non-zero exit code.</p>
<p>Typically this is run with a script calling Git’s imitation of the <em>merge</em> command from the RCS package.</p>
<p>A sample script called <em>git merge-one-file</em> is included in the distribution.</p>
<p>ALERT ALERT ALERT! The Git "merge object order" is different from the RCS <em>merge</em> program merge object order. In the above ordering, the original is first. But the argument order to the 3-way merge program <em>merge</em> is to have the original in the middle. Don’t ask me why.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>torvalds@ppc970:~/merge-test&gt; git merge-index cat MM
This is MM from the original tree.              # original
This is modified MM in the branch A.            # merge1
This is modified MM in the branch B.            # merge2
This is modified MM in the branch B.            # current contents</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>torvalds@ppc970:~/merge-test&gt; git merge-index cat AA MM
cat: : No such file or directory
This is added AA in the branch A.
This is added AA in the branch B.
This is added AA in the branch B.
fatal: merge program failed</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>where the latter example shows how <em>git merge-index</em> will stop trying to merge once anything has returned an error (i.e., <strong>cat</strong> returned an error for the AA file, because it didn’t exist in the original, and thus <em>git merge-index</em> didn’t even try to merge the MM thing).</p>
