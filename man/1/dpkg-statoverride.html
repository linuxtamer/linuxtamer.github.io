<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>dpkg-statoverride - override ownership and mode of files</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>dpkg-statoverride</strong> [<em>option</em>...] <em>command</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>“<strong>stat overrides</strong>” are a way to tell <strong>dpkg</strong>(1) to use a different owner or mode for a path when a package is installed (this applies to any filesystem object that <strong>dpkg</strong> handles, including directories, devices, etc.). This can be used to force programs that are normally setuid to be install without a setuid flag, or only executable by a certain group.</p>
<p><strong>dpkg-statoverride</strong> is a utility to manage the list of stat overrides. It has three basic functions: adding, removing and listing overrides.</p>
<h1>COMMANDS</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Add an override for <em>path</em>. <em>path</em> does not need to exist when this command is used; the override will be stored and used later. Users and groups can be specified by their name (for example <strong>root</strong> or <strong>nobody</strong>), or by their number by prepending the number with a ‘<strong>#</strong>’ (for example <strong>#0</strong> or <strong>#65534</strong>). The <em>mode</em> needs to be specified in octal. If <strong>--update</strong> is specified and <em>path</em> exists, it is immediately set to the new owner and mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove an override for <em>path</em>, the status of <em>path</em> is left unchanged by this command.</p></li>
<li><p>List all overrides. If a glob pattern is specified restrict the output to overrides which match the glob.</p></li>
<li><p>Show the usage message and exit.</p></li>
<li><p>Give help about the <strong>--force-</strong><em>thing</em> options (since dpkg 1.19.5).</p></li>
<li><p>Show the version and exit.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Set the administrative directory to <em>directory</em>. This is where the <em>statoverride</em> file is stored. Defaults to «<em>/var/lib/dpkg</em>».</p></li>
<li><p>Set the installation directory, which refers to the directory where packages get installed (since dpkg 1.19.2). Defaults to «<em>/</em>».</p></li>
<li><p>Set the root directory to <strong>directory</strong>, which sets the installation directory to «<em>directory</em>» and the administrative directory to «<em>directory</em><strong>/var/lib/dpkg</strong>» (since dpkg 1.19.2).</p></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Force or refuse (<strong>no-force</strong> and <strong>refuse</strong> mean the same thing) to do some things (since dpkg 1.19.5). <em>things</em> is a comma separated list of things specified below. <strong>--force-help</strong> displays a message describing them. Things marked with (*) are forced by default. <em>Warning: These options are mostly intended to be used by experts only.</em> Using them without fully understanding their effects may break your whole system. <strong>all</strong>: Turns on (or off) all force options. <strong>statoverride-add</strong>: Overwrite an existing stat override when adding it (since dpkg 1.19.5). <strong>statoverride-remove</strong>: Ignore a missing stat override when removing it (since dpkg 1.19.5). <strong>security-mac</strong>(*): Use platform-specific Mandatory Access Controls (MAC) based security when installing files into the filesystem (since dpkg 1.19.5). On Linux systems the implementation uses SELinux.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Force an action, even if a sanity check would otherwise prohibit it. This is necessary to override an existing override. This option is deprecated (since dpkg 1.19.5), it is replaced by <strong>--force-all</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Immediately try to change the <em>path</em> to the new owner and mode if it exists.</p></li>
<li><p>Be less verbose about what we do.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li><p>The requested action was successfully performed.</p></li>
<li><p>For <strong>--list</strong>, if there are no overrides or none match the supplied glob.</p></li>
<li><p>Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line usage, or interactions with the system, such as accesses to the database, memory allocations, etc.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>If set and the <strong>--instdir</strong> or <strong>--root</strong> options have not been specified, it will be used as the filesystem root directory (since dpkg 1.19.2).</p></li>
<li><p>If set and the <strong>--admindir</strong> or <strong>--root</strong> options have not been specified, it will be used as the <strong>dpkg</strong> data directory.</p></li>
<li><p>If set and none of the <strong>--force-</strong><em>...</em> options have been specified, it will be used as the force options to use (since dpkg 1.19.5).</p></li>
<li><p>Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5). The currently accepted values are: <strong>auto</strong> (default), <strong>always</strong> and <strong>never</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>File which contains the current list of stat overrides of the system. It is located in the <strong>dpkg</strong> administration directory, along with other files important to <strong>dpkg</strong>, such as <em>status</em> or <em>available</em>. <strong>Note:</strong> <strong>dpkg-statoverride</strong> preserves the old copy of this file, with extension “-old”, before replacing it with the new one.</p></li>
