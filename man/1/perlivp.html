<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>perlivp - Perl Installation Verification Procedure</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>perlivp</strong> [<strong>-p</strong>] [<strong>-v</strong>] [<strong>-h</strong>]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>perlivp</strong> program is set up at Perl source code build time to test the Perl version it was built under. It can be used after running:</p>
<p>make install</p>
<p>(or your platform's equivalent procedure) to verify that <strong>perl</strong> and its libraries have been installed correctly. A correct installation is verified by output that looks like:</p>
<p>ok 1 ok 2</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Prints out a brief help message.</p></li>
<li><p>Gives a description of each test prior to performing it.</p></li>
<li><p>Gives more detailed information about each test, after it has been performed. Note that any failed tests ought to print out some extra information whether or not -v is thrown.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>DIAGNOSTICS</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>print # Perl binary '$perlpath' does not appear executable.\n; Likely to occur for a perl binary that was not properly installed. Correct by conducting a proper installation.</p></li>
<li><p>print # Perl version '$]' installed, expected <code>$ivp_VERSION</code>.\n; Likely to occur for a perl that was not properly installed. Correct by conducting a proper installation.</p></li>
<li><p>print # Perl \@INC directory '$_' does not appear to exist.\n; Likely to occur for a perl library tree that was not properly installed. Correct by conducting a proper installation.</p></li>
<li><p>print # Needed module '$_' does not appear to be properly installed.\n; One of the two modules that is used by perlivp was not present in the installation. This is a serious error since it adversely affects perlivp's ability to function. You may be able to correct this by performing a proper perl installation.</p></li>
<li><p>print # Required module '$_' does not appear to be properly installed.\n; An attempt to <code>eval "require $module"</code> failed, even though the list of extensions indicated that it should succeed. Correct by conducting a proper installation.</p></li>
<li><p>print # Unnecessary module 'bLuRfle' appears to be installed.\n; This test not coming out ok could indicate that you have in fact installed a bLuRfle.pm module or that the <code>eval " require \"$module_name.pm\"; "</code> test may give misleading results with your installation of perl. If yours is the latter case then please let the author know.</p></li>
<li><p>print # file,+($#missing == 0) ? '' : 's', missing from installation:\n; One or more files turned up missing according to a run of <code>ExtUtils::Installed -&gt; validate()</code> over your installation. Correct by conducting a proper installation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For further information on how to conduct a proper installation consult the INSTALL file that comes with the perl source and the README file for your platform.</p>
