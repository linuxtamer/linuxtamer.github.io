<p>adds private key identities to the authentication agent,</p>
<p>When run without arguments, it adds the files</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>After loading a private key,</p>
<p>will try to load corresponding certificate information from the filename obtained by appending</p>
<p>to the name of the private key file. Alternative file names can be given on the command line.</p>
<p>If any file requires a passphrase,</p>
<p>asks for the passphrase from the user. The passphrase is read from the user's tty.</p>
<p>retries the last passphrase if multiple identity files are given.</p>
<p>The authentication agent must be running and the</p>
<p>environment variable must contain the name of its socket for</p>
<p>to work.</p>
<p>The options are as follows:</p>
<p>Indicates that added identities should be subject to confirmation before being used for authentication. Confirmation is performed by</p>
<p>Successful confirmation is signaled by a zero exit status from</p>
<p>rather than text entered into the requester.</p>
<p>Deletes all identities from the agent.</p>
<p>Instead of adding identities, removes identities from the agent. If</p>
<p>has been run without arguments, the keys for the default identities and their corresponding certificates will be removed. Otherwise, the argument list will be interpreted as a list of paths to public key files to specify keys and certificates to be removed from the agent. If no public key is found at a given path,</p>
<p>will append</p>
<p>and retry. If the argument list consists of</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>will read public keys to be removed from standard input.</p>
<p>Specifies the hash algorithm used when displaying key fingerprints. Valid options are:</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>The default is</p>
<p>Remove keys provided by the PKCS#11 shared library</p>
<p>Load resident keys from a FIDO authenticator.</p>
<p>When loading keys into or deleting keys from the agent, process plain private keys only and skip certificates.</p>
<p>Lists public key parameters of all identities currently represented by the agent.</p>
<p>Lists fingerprints of all identities currently represented by the agent.</p>
<p>Be quiet after a successful operation.</p>
<p>Specifies a path to a library that will be used when adding FIDO authenticator-hosted keys, overriding the default of using the internal USB HID support.</p>
<p>Add keys provided by the PKCS#11 shared library</p>
<p>Tests whether the private keys that correspond to the specified</p>
<p>files are usable by performing sign and verify operations on each.</p>
<p>Set a maximum lifetime when adding identities to an agent. The lifetime may be specified in seconds or in a time format specified in</p>
<p>Verbose mode. Causes</p>
<p>to print debugging messages about its progress. This is helpful in debugging problems. Multiple</p>
<p>options increase the verbosity. The maximum is 3.</p>
<p>Unlock the agent.</p>
<p>Lock the agent with a password.</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>needs a passphrase, it will read the passphrase from the current terminal if it was run from a terminal. If</p>
<p>does not have a terminal associated with it but</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>are set, it will execute the program specified by</p>
<p>(by default</p>
<p>and open an X11 window to read the passphrase. This is particularly useful when calling</p>
<p>from a</p>
<p>or related script.</p>
<p>allows further control over the use of an askpass program. If this variable is set to</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>will never attempt to use one. If it is set to</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>will prefer to use the askpass program instead of the TTY when requesting passwords. Finally, if the variable is set to</p>
<p>then the askpass program will be used for all passphrase input regardless of whether</p>
<p>is set.</p>
<p>Identifies the path of a</p>
<p>socket used to communicate with the agent.</p>
<p>Specifies a path to a library that will be used when loading any FIDO authenticator-hosted keys, overriding the default of using the built-in USB HID support.</p>
<p>Contains the DSA, ECDSA, authenticator-hosted ECDSA, Ed25519, authenticator-hosted Ed25519 or RSA authentication identity of the user.</p>
<p>Identity files should not be readable by anyone but the user. Note that</p>
<p>ignores identity files if they are accessible by others.</p>
<p>Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if the specified command fails, and 2 if</p>
<p>is unable to contact the authentication agent.</p>
<p>OpenSSH is a derivative of the original and free ssh 1.2.12 release by Tatu Ylonen. Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt and Dug Song removed many bugs, re-added newer features and created OpenSSH. Markus Friedl contributed the support for SSH protocol versions 1.5 and 2.0.</p>
