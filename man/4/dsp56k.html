<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>dsp56k - DSP56001 interface device</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>#include &lt;asm/dsp56k.h&gt;

ssize_t read(int fd, void *data, size_t length);
ssize_t write(int fd, void *data, size_t length);

int ioctl(int fd, DSP56K_UPLOAD, struct dsp56k_upload *program);
int ioctl(int fd, DSP56K_SET_TX_WSIZE, int wsize);
int ioctl(int fd, DSP56K_SET_RX_WSIZE, int wsize);
int ioctl(int fd, DSP56K_HOST_FLAGS, struct dsp56k_host_flags *flags);
int ioctl(int fd, DSP56K_HOST_CMD, int cmd);</code></pre>
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p>The <strong>dsp56k</strong> device is a character device with major number 55 and minor number 0.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The Motorola DSP56001 is a fully programmable 24-bit digital signal processor found in Atari Falcon030-compatible computers. The <em>dsp56k</em> special file is used to control the DSP56001, and to send and receive data using the bidirectional handshaked host port.</p>
<p>To send a data stream to the signal processor, use <strong>write</strong>(2) to the device, and <strong>read</strong>(2) to receive processed data. The data can be sent or received in 8, 16, 24, or 32-bit quantities on the host side, but will always be seen as 24-bit quantities in the DSP56001.</p>
<p>The following <strong>ioctl</strong>(2) calls are used to control the <em>dsp56k</em> device:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>resets the DSP56001 and uploads a program. The third <strong>ioctl</strong>(2) argument must be a pointer to a <em>struct dsp56k_upload</em> with members <em>bin</em> pointing to a DSP56001 binary program, and <em>len</em> set to the length of the program, counted in 24-bit words.</p></li>
<li><p>sets the transmit word size. Allowed values are in the range 1 to 4, and is the number of bytes that will be sent at a time to the DSP56001. These data quantities will either be padded with bytes containing zero, or truncated to fit the native 24-bit data format of the DSP56001.</p></li>
<li><p>sets the receive word size. Allowed values are in the range 1 to 4, and is the number of bytes that will be received at a time from the DSP56001. These data quantities will either truncated, or padded with a null byte ('\0') to fit the native 24-bit data format of the DSP56001.</p></li>
<li><p>read and write the host flags. The host flags are four general-purpose bits that can be read by both the hosting computer and the DSP56001. Bits 0 and 1 can be written by the host, and bits 2 and 3 can be written by the DSP56001.</p>
<p>To access the host flags, the third <strong>ioctl</strong>(2) argument must be a pointer to a <em>struct dsp56k_host_flags</em>. If bit 0 or 1 is set in the <em>dir</em> member, the corresponding bit in <em>out</em> will be written to the host flags. The state of all host flags will be returned in the lower four bits of the <em>status</em> member.</p></li>
<li><p>sends a host command. Allowed values are in the range 0 to 31, and is a user-defined command handled by the program running in the DSP56001.</p></li>
</ul>
