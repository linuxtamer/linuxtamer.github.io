<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>mem, kmem, port - system memory, kernel memory and system ports</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><em>/dev/mem</em> is a character device file that is an image of the main memory of the computer. It may be used, for example, to examine (and even patch) the system.</p>
<p>Byte addresses in <em>/dev/mem</em> are interpreted as physical memory addresses. References to nonexistent locations cause errors to be returned.</p>
<p>Examining and patching is likely to lead to unexpected results when read-only or write-only bits are present.</p>
<p>Since Linux 2.6.26, and depending on the architecture, the <strong>CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM</strong> kernel configuration option limits the areas which can be accessed through this file. For example: on x86, RAM access is not allowed but accessing memory-mapped PCI regions is.</p>
<p>It is typically created by:</p>
<pre><code>mknod -m 660 /dev/mem c 1 1
chown root:kmem /dev/mem</code></pre>
<p>The file <em>/dev/kmem</em> is the same as <em>/dev/mem</em>, except that the kernel virtual memory rather than physical memory is accessed. Since Linux 2.6.26, this file is available only if the <strong>CONFIG_DEVKMEM</strong> kernel configuration option is enabled.</p>
<p>It is typically created by:</p>
<pre><code>mknod -m 640 /dev/kmem c 1 2
chown root:kmem /dev/kmem</code></pre>
<p><em>/dev/port</em> is similar to <em>/dev/mem</em>, but the I/O ports are accessed.</p>
<p>It is typically created by:</p>
<pre><code>mknod -m 660 /dev/port c 1 4
chown root:kmem /dev/port</code></pre>
