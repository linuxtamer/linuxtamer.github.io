<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>ptmx, pts - pseudoterminal master and slave</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The file <em>/dev/ptmx</em> (the pseudoterminal multiplexor device) is a character file with major number 5 and minor number 2, usually with mode 0666 and ownership root:root. It is used to create a pseudoterminal master and slave pair.</p>
<p>When a process opens <em>/dev/ptmx</em>, it gets a file descriptor for a pseudoterminal master and a pseudoterminal slave device is created in the <em>/dev/pts</em> directory. Each file descriptor obtained by opening <em>/dev/ptmx</em> is an independent pseudoterminal master with its own associated slave, whose path can be found by passing the file descriptor to <strong>ptsname</strong>(3).</p>
<p>Before opening the pseudoterminal slave, you must pass the master's file descriptor to <strong>grantpt</strong>(3) and <strong>unlockpt</strong>(3).</p>
<p>Once both the pseudoterminal master and slave are open, the slave provides processes with an interface that is identical to that of a real terminal.</p>
<p>Data written to the slave is presented on the master file descriptor as input. Data written to the master is presented to the slave as input.</p>
<p>In practice, pseudoterminals are used for implementing terminal emulators such as <strong>xterm</strong>(1), in which data read from the pseudoterminal master is interpreted by the application in the same way a real terminal would interpret the data, and for implementing remote-login programs such as <strong>sshd</strong>(8), in which data read from the pseudoterminal master is sent across the network to a client program that is connected to a terminal or terminal emulator.</p>
<p>Pseudoterminals can also be used to send input to programs that normally refuse to read input from pipes (such as <strong>su</strong>(1), and <strong>passwd</strong>(1)).</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<p><em>/dev/ptmx</em>, <em>/dev/pts/*</em></p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>The Linux support for the above (known as UNIX 98 pseudoterminal naming) is done using the <em>devpts</em> filesystem, which should be mounted on <em>/dev/pts</em>.</p>
