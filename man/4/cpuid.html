<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>cpuid - x86 CPUID access device</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>CPUID provides an interface for querying information about the x86 CPU.</p>
<p>This device is accessed by <strong>lseek</strong>(2) or <strong>pread</strong>(2) to the appropriate CPUID level and reading in chunks of 16 bytes. A larger read size means multiple reads of consecutive levels.</p>
<p>The lower 32 bits of the file position is used as the incoming <em>%eax</em>, and the upper 32 bits of the file position as the incoming <em>%ecx</em>, the latter is intended for "counting" <em>eax</em> levels like <em>eax=4</em>.</p>
<p>This driver uses <em>/dev/cpu/CPUNUM/cpuid</em>, where <em>CPUNUM</em> is the minor number, and on an SMP box will direct the access to CPU <em>CPUNUM</em> as listed in <em>/proc/cpuinfo</em>.</p>
<p>This file is protected so that it can be read only by the user <em>root</em>, or members of the group <em>root</em>.</p>
<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>The CPUID instruction can be directly executed by a program using inline assembler. However this device allows convenient access to all CPUs without changing process affinity.</p>
<p>Most of the information in <em>cpuid</em> is reported by the kernel in cooked form either in <em>/proc/cpuinfo</em> or through subdirectories in <em>/sys/devices/system/cpu</em>. Direct CPUID access through this device should only be used in exceptional cases.</p>
<p>The <em>cpuid</em> driver is not auto-loaded. On modular kernels you might need to use the following command to load it explicitly before use:</p>
<pre><code>$ modprobe cpuid</code></pre>
<p>There is no support for CPUID functions that require additional input registers.</p>
<p>Very old x86 CPUs don't support CPUID.</p>
